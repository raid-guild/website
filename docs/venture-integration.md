# Venture Beyond integration

Design and Figma asset handoff: Luis Blanco (Louchi), https://estudioblanco.org.

Source: https://github.com/luisblancoach/website/tree/handoff/venture-beyond-dekan
Imported tip: a195359. All seven original commits are retained as merge ancestry,
including their original author information. HANDOFF.md is the original handoff;
this document records subsequent integration decisions rather than rewriting it.

Integration decisions:
- Use self-hosted Afacad Flux with CSS slants instead of the missing Grinder cuts.
  Keep Ubuntu body and Ubuntu Mono supporting type from the handoff.
- Preserve the local foliage front door and direct inquiry route.
- Include Talent & Placement as a proposed spear; keep the handbook accessible.
- Retain the supplied illustrations, palettes, icons, portraits and video scenes.
- Make section sizing responsive rather than enforcing Figma heights when content grows.

Clean scene exports supplied by Louchi in Assets.zip on 2026-09-09:
- Video/wind.mp4 → hero-light.mp4 (2200 × 940).
- Video/forest.mp4 → hero-dark.mp4 (2184 × 948).
- Video/Animated Scene.mp4 → manifesto.mp4 (2200 × 940).
These replace the previous preview videos with background-only artwork. Web copies
use H.264 CRF 23, yuv420p and fast-start metadata, with audio removed. Posters are
extracted from the matching exports. Playback pauses offscreen, in hidden tabs,
and for reduced-motion preferences; the existing hover discovery layer is retained.

Walkthrough parity pass:
- Continuous word ticker and counter-moving statistics band, with pause controls
  and static, wrapped content for reduced-motion preferences.
- Lighter dark-mode card surfaces; stronger interaction colors apply on hover/focus.
- Contact artwork uses the genuinely transparent professions/Druid 2.png export
  from Assets.zip instead of the earlier cream-backed PNG.
- Night navigation/theme switch use navy surfaces; the switch stays separate.
Statistics remain unverified mockup values, not newly validated claims.

Loop experiment: hero playback uses separate *-pingpong.mp4 derivatives, with
the original forward sequence followed by its reverse (duplicate endpoint frames
omitted). The original clean exports remain available for comparison. Reverse
segments are processed in bounded 48-frame chunks to limit encoding memory use.
The browser plays one continuous file rather than switching players at the seam.
The creed/manifesto remains forward-only because of its flying bird. Its
manifesto-crossfade.mp4 derivative blends the final 0.75 seconds with the opening
0.75 seconds, then loops to the next forward frame without reversing motion.
Statistical and portfolio copy from the design remains mockup content requiring
editorial verification before release. No Grinder files are bundled or required.
