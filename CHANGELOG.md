## Unreleased

## 2026-10-30 · Approved Venture Beyond release `07031e2`

- Published to Vercel Production in `raidguild-venture-beyond-review`, deployment
  `dpl_Bz4p12G9bayZT3kdJo41U73PGpGM` (`https://raidguild-venture-beyond-review.vercel.app`).
- `/clients` and `/community` return 200 publicly. The release includes the approved landing-page
  refinements, shared CTA system, pinned contact scenes, responsive profession gallery, normalized
  Builders/People/Hats cards, form stepper and dropdown updates, and route-specific sharing metadata.
- Verified before publish: `bun run test` 85/85, TypeScript, lint with one pre-existing warning, and
  production build. The deployment was created from a clean archive with `SHOW_REVIEW_FLAGS=false`.

## 2026-10-29 · Iteration 04 commit (pushed to `fork/feat/venture-beyond-integration`, not deployed)

- Moloch title with the RaidGuild logo; the owner's Explore description; display face kept for "The Guild
  runs on owners"; builder layouts by result count on one full-width coral plane; Hats Tree and Projects
  swapped on /community; canonical-pink resting CTAs with distinct hover and pressed states in both themes.
- Verified: `bun run test` 80/80, `tsc`, lint (0 errors), isolated production build, browser suite
  1112/1112 on the dev server and the production build. No Git preview (the fork has no Vercel Git
  integration). Not verified: Safari, Firefox, devices, screen readers.

## 2026-10-29 · Iteration 03 commit `6ecb1c7` (pushed; preview `dpl_9RDNQZ5VNvT9hcjDtC5ANj5ho3G8`, not production)

- Final visual refinement pass for `/clients` and `/community`: the hero curtain on both routes; the
  new /community order with Moloch after Queen Raida; the Hats Tree with branches, artwork-first cards
  and select-to-enlarge; one two-level heading scale; still builder lists in the wall's style; the
  coral creed highlight; one stroke around the Hire panel.
- Verified: `bun run test` 79/79, `tsc`, lint (0 errors), isolated production build, browser suite
  882/882 on the dev server and the production build. No preview: the fork has no Vercel Git
  integration. Not verified: Safari, Firefox, devices, screen readers.

## 2026-10-29 · Iteration 02 commit `a8ff16c` (pushed to `fork/feat/venture-beyond-integration`, not deployed manually)

- Design system normalization iteration 01, the Community visual refinement follow-up and iteration 02
  for `/clients` and `/community`: the owner's hero, Join and Projects copy; no hero parallax; one
  headline rule; Ubuntu H3s; the Guild kit expander; held Queen Raida and Moloch artwork; a two-column
  Hats Tree; one builder card system on a tilted coral band; CTA states, icons and 44 px targets;
  accordion contrast; the creed highlight; the owner's artwork in `public/images/venture/`.
- Verified: `bun run test` 79/79, `tsc`, lint (0 errors), isolated production build, browser suite
  712/712 on the dev server and on the production build. Not verified: Safari, Firefox, devices,
  screen readers.
- Documentation only (2026-10-29, committed with iteration 02): `STATUS.md` and this file reconciled with release
  `2bf270d`, including the corrections below.
- Design system normalization, iteration 01 (2026-10-29, committed with iteration 02): one hero scale
  and dark-theme button treatment for `/clients` and `/community`; `/community` reorganized (About
  RaidGuild restored from `f842d87`, Queen Raida and About Moloch as immersive features, the Hats
  Tree replacing "Keepers of the signal", the shared builder wall, Services and inquiry panel) with
  distinct dark scenes; seven placeholder PNGs for Moloch and the five featured hats.
- Community visual refinement follow-up (2026-10-29, committed with iteration 02): the owner's Queen
  Raida, Moloch and Hats artwork (desktop, rectangle and mobile cuts); Join headline on one line per
  segment; builder wall on a tilted coral band; coral-stroked Join panel; Moloch on coral with navy
  text; Hats Tree with the RaidGuild parent mark, less text and one link; Ubuntu H3s on /community.

## 2026-10-28 · Review release `2bf270d`

- `2bf270d`: the October 28 refinements, 30 files.
  - `/clients`: Tae's copy for all nine case studies; Daedalus links to ddls.co with the owner's
    new assets; review flags off in local development; "The Guild runs on owners, not employees.";
    the builder heading on the showcase scale, adaptive grids for 1–8 filtered builders, and a
    masonry wall at 36 px/s running edge to edge, each builder shown once; the inquiry form
    replacing its introduction in the light-blue module, compact and line-based; the hero curtain
    (4ffb591) restored; showcase rotation every 3 s with a crossfade; "Build with us"; a coral,
    taller mobile creed.
  - `/community`: "Join our community"; the Guild section "About Moloch" with the owner's
    Moloch, Hats Tree and stewardship copy, and links to DAO Roles and Hats Protocol.
- Deployed to Vercel Production in `raidguild-venture-beyond-review`, deployment
  `dpl_HqkPYA55qh5V9QHFQpUxwWZ1xjko` (https://raidguild-venture-beyond-review.vercel.app,
  `SHOW_REVIEW_FLAGS=false`), from a clean `git archive`, and verified in production. Source:
  `~/Projects/raidguild-backups/2026-10-28/DEPLOY-vercel-review-2bf270d.md`.
- Verified: release tree `bun run test` 71/71, `bunx tsc --noEmit`, `bun run build`; on the
  production URL the general (75/75), rotation and wall (66/66), October 28 (96/96) and marquee
  (40/40) suites, and the 1440 px pass of the Frame 122/123 suite (its other widths only on the
  identical local build). Not verified: form submission, Safari, Firefox, physical devices, screen
  readers.
- Earlier the same evening, `dpl_7Bm3eKJtSDLEHyeHRRPdHfU4Nx1N` (21:28) and
  `dpl_DsHcdtCVBX6QNKNHSx4iwUaxyhxz` (22:16) were deployed outside this session from an
  uncommitted working tree; `dpl_HqkPYA…` superseded both.
- Corrections to the documentation committed in `2bf270d`: its `STATUS.md` said the
  `HeaderJoin.tsx` lint warning was removed (it was not; `bun run lint` still reports the unused
  `ThemeAnchor`) and that the October 23 reference checkout was unavailable (it is available at
  `40f3910`); its `STATUS.md` named `dpl_7Bm3…` as the review; and its `CHANGELOG.md` listed this
  work as uncommitted and not deployed. Corrected in the uncommitted documentation update.
