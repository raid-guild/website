# STATUS

## Current release preparation · 2026-11-11

- Worktree: `/home/dekanjbrown/Documents/Codex/2026-11-09/i-x20/work/website-release-merge`, an isolated checkout of `review/venture-beyond-redesign`. The original checkout and its untracked artwork and lockfile were untouched.
- Branch state: the review tip `7d0e878` was reconciled with `origin/main` `b02d67b` for the existing website PR. The resulting merge commit is this checkout's HEAD; the worktree is clean at close. No production merge or deployment was performed here.
- Conflicts resolved in `package.json`, `src/middleware.ts`, and `tests/agent-readiness.test.mjs`: retain the redesign's complete test and brand scripts, legacy audience redirect, and current Portal join URL while keeping `main`'s Markdown negotiation and discovery headers. Fixed one pre-existing CSS Modules purity error in `src/components/venture/venture.module.css` by scoping the summary focus selector to `.site`; the focus appearance is unchanged.
- Verification: `bun install --frozen-lockfile`, `bun run test` (8 test files passed), `bunx tsc --noEmit --incremental false`, `bun run lint` (0 errors, 1 existing `ThemeAnchor` warning), and `SHOW_REVIEW_FLAGS=false bun run build` (Next.js Turbopack, 19/19 static pages generated) passed. The first sandboxed build could not fetch Ubuntu fonts from Google; the successful run used approved network access. A diagnostic Webpack run exposed the CSS selector error; its temporary build configuration was restored before the passing build.
- October 23 visual reference comparison: not verified in this merge preparation, which changes no rendered design content. Editorial parity: not verified. The historical baseline tag is absent from this isolated clone; no visual or editorial edits were made.
- Next priority: independently review the merge, then push the reviewed branch to update its PR. Merge to `main` and production verification remain owner release steps.

The older snapshot below records the November 4 review state and is retained for history.

Snapshot: 2026-11-04 (-0300), baseline commit for Dekan's review (section "November 4"); earlier: see "November 3, late night", "November 3, night" and "November 3, evening" below for the latest uncommitted pass. HEAD `233777b` (November 3 iteration, owner-approved production deploy of
the review project; not pushed; see "Deployed review"). Uncommitted: STATUS.md and the owner's files (`package.json`,
21 deleted legacy images, `clients.pdf`, `LastDuel-Ex2Retalic.otf`). The Figma pilot below changed no repository
file. **Blocker before any commit or deploy: the Last Duel files' own licence field forbids web
hosting and redistribution** (open question 64).

**Figma export (current task):** pilot `Clients / Light / 1440×900` built and awaiting owner review; the other 19
compositions are not started (section "November 3 (Figma pilot)").

**Next priority:** the owner reviews the galleries / FAQ (and supplies the FAQ placeholder values), the hero desktop pass and the hero experiment (70), the mobile pass and the hierarchy pass and decides 64 (licence), 65 (card
names), 67 (bottom-line italic), 68 (creed on desktop) and 69 (Moloch mark); commit / deploy only once those are
settled and approved. (69 is resolved: the Moloch mark was removed.)

## November 4: baseline commit and PR for Dekan's review (owner request)

- One baseline commit on `feat/venture-beyond-integration` with this iteration only (the November 3 work: Figma
  pass rounds 1–3, widows and tablet fits, selectors, client reasons and FAQ, chevrons, /community order and
  surfaces, Hats flip, steward flip, builder wall, category buttons, Projects Explorer replacing "Follow your
  curiosity", tests and docs). Excluded: package.json, the 21 legacy image deletions, clients.pdf,
  LastDuel-Ex2Retalic.otf, .DS_Store, .env*.
- Owner decisions (2026-11-04): push with the five Last Duel font files (first push of 04da57f; the owner confirms
  the right to publish them in the public repos; supersedes the "review preview only" scope of question 64), and
  open the PR against raid-guild/website `main`. Push and PR only: no merge, deploy, promotion or alias change.

## November 3, night: Vercel preview of the working tree (owner request), nothing committed

- Preview: https://raidguild-venture-beyond-review-enve71f46.vercel.app, `dpl_DaWdfzxANbXHjSGXbDctk3ej2sk2`, target
  preview, Ready (Vercel login required). Built from a clean copy: HEAD `233777b` + this iteration's uncommitted
  files; excluded package.json, the 21 legacy deletions, clients.pdf, LastDuel-Ex2Retalic.otf, .DS_Store, .env*.
  `--build-env SHOW_REVIEW_FLAGS=false` for this deployment only; project settings unchanged.
- Pre-deploy (clean copy): tsc OK, tests 91/91, lint 0 errors, production build OK; on the built app (:3020) the
  10-case set and the 24 explorer checks pass.
- On the preview (`vercel curl`): /clients 200, /community 200, / 200 with the expected markers (/ keeps its old
  Explore module). Review alias and production unchanged.
- The deployed code is not in any commit. Record and patch: `~/Projects/raidguild-backups/2026-11-03/`
  (`DEPLOY-vercel-preview-wt2.md`, `iteration-wt2.patch`, `iteration-wt2-new-files.tar`).
- Local servers: :3018 (dev, current tree) and :3020 (`next start` of the clean copy) were started this session;
  :3017 is stale.

## November 3, late night, "Open the Portal" outline fix, uncommitted

- The secondary pill on the Explore / Projects heading showed two dark fills (the navy secondary surface and the
  navy icon disc). The section now joins the existing transparent-outline rule (`venture.module.css`, the
  `:is(.prologue, .contact)` outline block → `:is(.prologue, .contact, .fieldNotes)`): transparent pill and disc,
  cream edge, label and glyph; hover a 9 % cream tint. Verified Day / Night 1440 and Day 402 (computed + shots).
  Tests 91/91; lint 0 errors.

## November 3, late night, explorer caption over the media, uncommitted

- Owner: category (eyebrow), one-line title and description now sit over the screenshot on a transparent shadow
  rising from the window's foot (section colour: dark green Day, navy Night; .95 → .9 → .55 → 0), with "Explore
  now" at the lower right. The shadow lets clicks through to the screenshot (larger view). Descriptions (≤ 177
  characters) take two or three lines, never clipped. 640–899 px: the button drops under the text, right-aligned.
  Phones (< 640 px, a ~200 px window): caption and button stay under the image; chevrons centre on the image.
  This overrides the earlier "no gradients / text over images" rule for this window only, at the owner's request.
- Checks (:3018): explorer set all pass (default, select, metadata, chevrons, Explore now, categories, Explore all,
  lightbox, Escape, keyboard, phones no overflow, themes, reduced motion, "/" unchanged); light-screenshot
  legibility reviewed in both themes. `tsc` OK; lint 0 errors (1 existing warning); tests 91/91.

## November 3, late night, explorer action, uncommitted

- The media window's two actions ("Play now here" / "Open new tab") are replaced by one primary pill without
  icon, "Explore now": the artifact in a new tab (the Portal: its on-page experience). The in-place player
  (iframe) is removed, so the framing limit noted below (question 92) no longer applies. Static screenshots
  stay; per-artifact recordings are a possible later step (owner). Label centred at every width.
- Checks (:3018): the explorer set incl. "one primary Explore now, new tab, no icon, no iframe": all pass.
  `tsc` OK; lint 0 errors (1 existing warning); `bun run test` 91/91.

## November 3, late night, project explorer round 2, uncommitted

- Category buttons back (Everything, Experiences, Games, Tools & interfaces, Field notes; the old gallery's
  labels and rules), above the explorer, shared category style (selected = magenta edge, no fill). Filtering
  keeps the selection when it is in the category, else selects the category's first item.
- "01 / 44 projects" eyebrow removed (the list keeps a visually hidden label with the count).
- Media window: previous / next chevrons on its edges (wrap around, within the category); "Play now here"
  (primary) loads the live artifact in the viewport (iframe, sandboxed), "Stop playing" returns to the
  screenshot; "Open new tab" (secondary, ↗). The Portal: "Play now here" opens the on-page Portal. The actions sit
  over the screenshot's lower left from 640 px, under the viewport while playing and on phones (full width).
  Framing: the Railway-hosted artifacts' CSP frame-ancestors allow only portal.raidguild.org, *.up.railway.app and
  localhost, so on the review / production domains those artifacts show "Open new tab" only; handbook,
  portal.raidguild.org pages and livelive have no framing restriction. Adding the site's domains to the artifacts'
  frame-ancestors (outside this repo) would enable playing them here everywhere (question 92).
- "Open the Portal": secondary pill with the sword icon on the heading's row (right); full width under the intro
  on phones (`WallOfCuriosities.tsx`). The metadata no longer carries an action.
- Artifact title (metadata): technical, not display: Last Duel Bold upright, mixed case, one line, fitted to the
  column by its length (16–28 px), ellipsis beyond. The list cards keep Ubuntu bold.
- Checks (:3018): the ten explorer checks plus categories, chevrons, play / stop / new tab, header Portal button
  (opens the Portal), no counter, technical title, no old-module remnants, 768 / 1920 layouts, "/" unchanged: all
  pass. `tsc` OK; lint 0 errors (1 existing warning); `bun run test` 91/91.

## November 3, late night, project explorer replaces Explore (/community), uncommitted

- Old module identified: `sections/WallOfCuriosities.tsx` (section shell) + `components/ArtifactGallery.tsx` /
  `ArtifactGallery.module.css` (filter pills, elastic zoom grid, "+" tiles, text-over-image captions, the
  "Follow your curiosity." panel, footnote) and the `#work` decorative layers (dot texture, column lines, circle).
  It rendered on /community and "/"; owner: replace on /community only, "/" untouched (verified it still shows
  the old module).
- New: `sections/ProjectExplorer.tsx` + `explorer.module.css`. Main media viewport (≈ 2/3 of the row at ≥ 1000 px;
  966 px at 1920), metadata below (category, title, description, action: "Open the Portal" for the Portal,
  "Explore the project" / "Read the post" ↗ for the others), a stack of horizontal cards (thumbnail, category,
  title) on the right, six visible, "Explore all 44" (text action) reveals the rest (scrolls inside the column on
  desktop), "Show fewer" returns. Default: The Portal. Cards: buttons with aria-current; Arrow Up / Down, Home,
  End; Enter / Space. Metadata is a polite live region. Main media opens a Radix dialog (larger view, focus trap,
  Escape, focus back to the media). Crossfade .28 s on change; none with reduced motion. Selected card: sky +
  dark green ink in Day, #303674 + cream in Night, magenta edge (as the builder / steward cards).
  Responsive: desktop two columns; tablet (640–999) viewport full width, stack in two columns below; phones one
  column (viewport, metadata, stack).
- Data and artwork reused: the Portal entry and fallback list (now exported from `ArtifactGallery.tsx`, no change
  on "/"), /api/artifacts, /api/posts, `resolveArtifactPreview`. No new artwork.
- Heading: "[ PROJECTS ] Projects and / experiments" (the B3.4 section name; the nav's "Projects" targets #work),
  replacing "What happens when builders follow their curiosity." (owner: no old title). The owner's intro stays.
  Flagged as wording (question 91). `community.ts`; `tests/narrative.test.mjs` updated (heading test).
- Removed: the #work dot texture / lines / circle on /community (`venture.module.css`), and my earlier Day card
  override for the old gallery in `ArtifactGallery.module.css`.
- Checks (:3018): 1 default artifact; 2 card selection swaps the viewport; 3 metadata follows; 4 Explore all
  6 → 44 and back; 5 lightbox opens (1280 px); 6 Escape closes, focus back on the media; 7 keyboard (Down, Enter,
  End, Home, Space, focus ring); 8 phones light / dark 402: no overflow, no wrapped controls, no broken images;
  9 theme tokens light / dark; 10 reduced motion (no animation, 0 s transitions; motion on otherwise). Also: no
  old strings, "+" buttons, filters or decorative layers in #work; 768 / 1920 layouts; "/" unchanged; the
  /community general set 0 failing. `tsc` OK; lint 0 errors (1 existing warning); `bun run test` 91/91.
- Open question 91: confirm the "Projects and experiments" heading (or supply one).

## November 3, late night, builder wall centring, uncommitted

- `venture.module.css` (end): the builder rows sit vertically centred in the coral band (flex column, symmetric
  padding `wall-gap + wall-extra / 2`, the rail's 8 / 24 px padding removed); band heights unchanged. Measured
  space above / below the rows: /community 58 / 58 (1920–1024), 46 / 47 (768), 42 / 43 (402); /clients 40 / 40,
  32 / 32, 28 / 28 (was 24 above and 56–92 below). The /community band is taller than its rows, hence the larger
  equal margins there. Band still meets Explore with no gap.
- Checks (on :3018): the 10-case set 0 failing; `tsc` OK; lint 0 errors (1 existing warning); `bun run test` 91/91.

## November 3, late night, owner round 2 (category buttons, stewards, FAQ label, builder wall), uncommitted

- Category buttons, selected (builder skill tabs `audience.module.css`; Explore filters `ArtifactGallery.module.css`):
  no fill; Moloch magenta 2 px border + 1 px inset (no size change), label in the surface's ink; both themes.
- Steward cards (/clients): names Last Duel Bold upright as the builder cards, one fitted size for all five
  (`min(24px, (100cqi - 8px) / 7.8)`, the card a size container; ECWireless 7.76 em): 24 px desktop, 17 px at
  1024 and 402, 14.6 px at 360, all inside the card on one line. The portrait turns over to the steward's hat
  (lib/data/hats.ts by role) on hover and keyboard focus; crossfade with reduced motion (`Stewardship.tsx`).
- /clients FAQ: the "[ Before you start ]" label removed (read as the section label, which repeated "before"
  from the title); `FaqContent.label` is optional; /community keeps "[ Before you join ]".
- Builder wall: +32 px coral under the last row (+24 px phones). On /community the wall runs edge to edge with
  square corners straight into Explore: #team bottom padding and its 960 px min-height (an older one-screen
  rule that left 33–81 px of cream) removed there. /clients keeps its plane and the cream before the stewards.
- Checks: 10-case set 0 failing (after fitting the steward names: the first run failed "escape" at 1024 / 402);
  steward flip by hover, keyboard and reduced motion; wall-to-Explore seam measured at 1920 / 1440 / 1024 / 768 /
  402 and screenshotted. `tsc` OK; lint 0 errors (1 existing warning); `bun run test` 91/91.
- Full-stack card art (both routes' galleries, `clients.ts`, `community.ts`): the blueprint sketch
  (`project-ship-schematic-v1.webp`, outside the illustration system) is replaced by the crashed-pod crew
  (`spear-edge-problem-v1.webp`, existing asset, contain fit). Owner's choice among the options offered; it repeats
  the scene of the builders module art on the same page. No unused illustration in the style existed.
- Local server: http://localhost:3017 kept serving a stale `clients.ts` (old card art) after the edit; stopping it
  was not permitted in this session, so a fresh `bun run dev --port 3018` was started to verify (both routes
  render the new art there). Restart 3017 (or use 3018) to see the current /clients.

## November 3, late night, owner round (cards, Membership, names, icons), uncommitted

- Gallery cards (`gallery.module.css`, supersedes the previous card state): in Day the image area is the sky at
  rest; the copy area keeps its light surface in every state; hover / focus-within adds the magenta edge (both
  themes). Shared by /clients services and /community capabilities.
- Membership (`.benefits`): back to the sky in Day (owner); Night keeps the raised navy. In Day it now continues
  the Hats tree's sky with no boundary between the two modules (owner's choice; see 88).
- Builder and steward cards (`venture.module.css`, end): light #F9F7E7 at rest in Day; hover / focus turns them sky
  with a 3 px magenta edge; Night keeps its surfaces and takes the magenta edge. On the builder band (itself
  magenta) the edge does not read: the hovered tile shows as sky only (see 89). The /clients steward cards sit
  on cream, where the edge shows.
- Builder names: Last Duel Bold upright (BoldEx2, 700) instead of Regular (owner). All names fit their tiles and
  clear the mark at 1920–360 on both routes.
- UI icons: Day / Night icons 20 px (were 16) in the top bar and the phone toggle (icon boxes unchanged, so the
  knob still lands on each).
- Checks: the 10-case set (incl. bold names): 0 failing; tile and card states by computed style and
  screenshots in both themes. `tsc` OK; lint 0 errors (1 existing warning); `bun run test` 91/91.
- Open questions: 88. Hats and Membership share the sky in Day with no seam; add a divider or spacing cue?
  89. On the magenta builder band, use a different active edge (dark green or cream) so the selection reads?

## November 3, late night, gallery card state, uncommitted

- `gallery.module.css` (end): a gallery card that is hovered or holds focus (its link) takes the sky #B8E0DF as
  its surface in Day (copy and art area) and the Moloch magenta edge in both themes; Night keeps the navy card.
  Shared by the /clients services and /community capabilities galleries. The link's 3 px focus ring stays dark
  green / cream (magenta on sky is 2.6:1, under 3:1). Instant with reduced motion.
- Checked (computed styles + screenshots): /community light 1440 and dark 1440, /clients light 1024 (reduced
  motion) and dark 402 (focus only, touch): rest / hover / focus surface, edge and link ring as above.
  `bun run test` 91/91; lint 0 errors.
- Note (87): in the active Day state the pink card label and second title line sit on sky at about 2.5:1, as on
  the Membership cards' celeste; acceptable for a transient state, or darken the accent there?

## November 3, late night, follow-up (/community order), uncommitted

- Order (`community/page.tsx`): Membership (benefits, "[ Membership ]") now follows Stewardship (the Hats tree,
  "[ STEWARDSHIP ]"), and the FAQ ("[ Before you join ]") follows Join the Guild ("[ JOIN THE GUILD ]"):
  hero → ticker → Guild → capabilities → Raida → Moloch → Hats → Membership → builders → Explore → Join → FAQ →
  creed. Modules identified by their own labels.
- Membership surface (`gallery.module.css`): next to the Hats tree it shared its surface in both themes (sky /
  #12163B) and the two read as one block; it now takes the light parchment #F9F7E7 in Day and the raised navy
  #252A61 in Night, distinct from Hats above and the builders below. Join → FAQ stay cream / navy (the Join
  scene fades into the FAQ, as before the swap in reverse).
- Checks: /community 4 cases of the focused set (light 1920, dark 1440 reduced motion, light 402, dark 402
  reduced motion) incl. the full order: 0 failing; section surfaces listed per theme; seams reviewed in
  screenshots. `tsc` OK; lint 0 errors (1 existing warning); `bun run test` 91/91.
- Open question 86: the nav item "Membership" still targets #guild (the Guild module), while the module labelled
  "[ Membership ]" is the benefits; point it at #benefits, or rename one of them?

## November 3, late night (/community owner list), uncommitted

- Hero: "FIND YOUR PEOPLE." enlarged to 1 / 1.15 of "BUILD SOMETHING TOGETHER." (was 1 / 1.4) from 761 px; phones
  cap it to the column (second line and its break unchanged). `venture.module.css` (end).
- Selector: the current option's outline (and the phone knob ring) is Moloch magenta (#EE3C78) in Day and Night;
  labels unchanged.
- Builder names (both routes; the /community masonry rail and the /clients tiles): Last Duel Regular upright
  (Ex2, 400) instead of the Oblique; settles question 65. Every name fits its tile and clears the sword mark at
  1920 / 1440 / 1024 / 768 / 402 / 360.
- Hats: a featured hat card turns over to its wearer on hover (pointer devices) and while selected (keyboard
  focus, tap): portrait, name, "Wears 1822.x"; crossfade with reduced motion; the wearer's name is in the
  button's accessible name, the back face is aria-hidden. Wearers come from the published `stewards` list
  (`lib/data/venture.ts`: Dekan, ECWireless, Takekek, Pupcakes, Louchi), not live Hats Protocol data. Wearer
  names are Ubuntu bold (Last Duel fitted to an 85–105 px card fell to 11 px). `HatsTree.tsx`, `hats.module.css`.
- Hats parent mark: Day shows `raidguild-green.png` (swords recoloured navy → #102D2C, new file; provenance row
  added); Night keeps `raidguild.png`. `lib/data/hats.ts` gains `imageDay`.
- Surfaces in Day: Hats tree sky (#B8E0DF) with dark-green ink, lines, rings and edges; Explore (#work) dark green
  with cream ink, Night-style card tokens on dark green (`ArtifactGallery.module.css`) and cream secondary CTA.
  Night unchanged for both.
- Order (`community/page.tsx`): hero → ticker → Guild → capabilities gallery → Raida → Moloch → Hats → builders
  → Explore → FAQ → Join → benefits → creed. The gallery's "Explore the Guild" CTA now points up to #guild.
- Checks: the 10-case set (selector magenta / muted / focus / theme flip, rows, Light navy audit, overflow,
  images, errors) plus /community order, Day surfaces, hero ratio, parent image per theme, builder name style,
  hat flip by hover (desktop), tap (phones) and crossfade (reduced motion): 0 failing. `tsc` OK; lint 0 errors
  (1 existing warning); `bun run test` 91/91. Not compared with Figma or October 23; Safari / Firefox not run.
- Open questions: 83. The hero ratio 1 / 1.15 is a judgement ("enlarge"); adjust? 84. Wearer pairing comes from
  the site's steward list (October); confirm it matches the live tree. 85. Should the "Explore the Guild" CTA in
  the capabilities gallery change now that the Guild sits above it?

## November 3, night (selector, client-facing /clients copy, reason rows, chevrons), uncommitted

- Selectors (both audience routes, both themes, all widths; `venture.module.css`, last block): the current Hire /
  Join and Day / Night option is a 1.5 px outline in the ink colour (Day #102D2C, Night cream) on the control's own
  surface, no fill; the other label muted (5.1:1 Day, 7.3:1 Night); the current theme icon coral. Phones: the
  toggle knob is the same outlined ring, current icon coral. Hover, focus ring (3 px), aria-current /
  aria-pressed / role=switch unchanged. "/" untouched (rules scoped to `.site[data-audience] .topBar`).
- /clients copy (owner brief: answer "Why should I choose RaidGuild for this project?"), `lib/narrative/clients.ts`:
  - Services gallery: intro and the six card bodies rewritten for buyers (were the published service copy and
    the internal "The Guild is the center of gravity … raids"). Titles, labels, art, links unchanged. Reused
    facts only: onchain since 2019 (practice copy), client names (showcase), handoff with docs (showcase / FAQ).
    No prices, timelines or guarantees. All bodies flagged (claim, draft).
  - New module "Why build with RaidGuild" (`sections/ClientReasons.tsx`, `id="why-raidguild"`) right after the
    gallery, same surface, reduced top padding: seven expandable reasons covering the brief's points (senior
    accountable teams; AI and blockchain where they earn their place; smart contracts / dApps; strategy to
    handoff; focused scope and ownership; weekly progress; maintainable systems with named clients). Bodies
    flagged as claims; process facts come from the (still flagged) buyer FAQ.
  - Buyer FAQ: "Questions before a raid" → "before we build"; "raids" → "projects" / "the build" in the
    answers. Placeholders kept.
- Expandable rows: each reason row = the full RaidGuild sigil (CTA icon disc #102D2C Day / #12163B Night, cream
  ring, coral swords, as `sigil-logo.svg`; decorative) + label + lucide chevron (down closed, turned 180° open;
  instant with reduced motion); heading > button with aria-expanded / aria-controls, region labelled by the
  button. The FAQ rows (both routes, shared `Faq.tsx`) swap the plus / minus for the same chevron; no sigil
  there (questions, not capabilities; see 80). Bug caught and fixed during the pass: removing the plus-sign CSS
  also removed `.faqAnswer p` and `.placeholder`; restored.
- Tests: `tests/narrative.test.mjs` gallery test now checks the six service titles, flagged client-facing bodies
  and no internal terms (it required the published bodies); new test for the seven reasons (flagged, no prices
  / durations / guarantees / "raid"); FAQ test adds "no raid". A reason title naming "ownership" is a claim
  (sensitive-statement rule).
- Validation (10 cases: /clients light 1440, dark 1920, light 768, dark 1024 reduced motion, light 402 reduced
  motion, dark 402; /community light 1920, dark 1440 reduced motion, light 402, dark 402 reduced motion): selector
  selected / unselected styles and contrast, phone knob, focus ring via Tab, theme flip with ARIA; 13 / 5 rows
  with aria wiring, chevrons, Enter / Space / click open and close, chevron turn and its transition (0 s with
  reduced motion); 7 sigils on one left edge and chevrons on one right edge, centred on their rows; overflow,
  broken images, console / page errors, text escaping controls, wrapped labels, Light navy audit: all pass.
  Gallery cards unclipped at 1920–360. `tsc` OK; lint 0 errors (1 existing warning); `bun run test` 91/91.
- Audit note: the navy audit now parses `color(srgb …)` (color-mix results), which the earlier script skipped;
  it found only the Sync Steward hat card's own indigo accent (`lib/data/hats.ts`), the documented exception
  above, so it is excluded, not changed.
- Not done: Figma or October 23 comparison (no artboard for these modules); Safari / Firefox; production build.
- Open questions: 80. Should the FAQ rows carry the sigil too, or keep chevron-only? 81. Approve the client
  copy (gallery intro and bodies, seven reasons, FAQ wording). 82. Muted unselected label strength (70 % ink).

## November 3, evening (re-orientation after a lost session; widows and tablet fits), uncommitted

- Re-oriented from the files and localhost only (the previous chat was lost): location, branch, HEAD `233777b`
  and the October 23 baseline (`40f3910`) match; the Figma-pass rounds one to three below are in the working tree
  and were re-verified, not re-implemented.
- Already correct (verified, unchanged): /community "BUILD SOMETHING TOGETHER." on one line from 761 px (phones
  keep the deliberate break before "TOGETHER." at 18 / 25 px); /clients inquiry subtitle on one line from 761
  px; stepper titles ("Scope & timing") on one line; MOLOCH 55.5 px (52 px phones), one line; "OUR CLIENTS"
  44 px; FAQ art and head spacing; Light CTA edge and disc #102D2C, Night cream / #12163B; Light navy audit
  0 elements on both routes at 1440, 768 and 402.
- Fixed:
  - Widows: `.site[data-audience] { text-wrap-style: pretty }` and `balance` on headings and their two-level
    lines (end of `venture.module.css`). Widow flags in the 10 cases 99 → 15; the rest are three-word headings
    already balanced (65–81 % last line), the footer motto in its narrow column, one /clients card body at 402
    ("…activate their / communities.", 36 %, kept by Chrome's pretty breaker), and hover captions hidden behind
    a 2-line clamp. Line counts elsewhere unchanged; "/" unchanged (measured).
  - Immersive features (Queen Raida, Moloch), 761–899 px: the copy stacks as on phones (`feature.module.css`).
    Before, at 761–880 "MOLOCH" (361 px) overran its 316–357 px column into the body, "TOGETHER WE / SLAY"
    broke with a widow, and at 761–768 the CTA label "FIND YOUR PATH INTO THE GUILD" escaped its pill (missed
    by the round-three check, which tested the pill box, not its text). The title is a flex column so the
    balance reaches the lead line ("TOGETHER / WE SLAY" at 900–1099; one line elsewhere).
  - Hats tree, 961–1199 px (audience routes): stays under the copy as at ≤ 960 (`hats.module.css`); beside it
    the cards were 85–105 px and "Infrastructure" / "Participation" ran out of them (pre-existing). Hats
    section at 1024: 775 → 1090 px tall.
  - `tests/cta-contrast.test.mjs`: the October 30 assertion "no dark-green edge exception" contradicted the
    November 3 Light UI rule and failed since round two (only the narrative tests were run then); replaced
    with a test that the audience Day block sets edge, disc and secondary label to #102D2C with ≥ 3:1 on
    cream / sky / coral and ≥ 4.5:1 label on cream. "/" keeps the navy-edge test.
- Checks: 10 focused cases (/clients light 1920, dark 1440, light 1024, dark 768, light 402; /community light
  1440, dark 1920, light 768, dark 402, light 1024): overflow, hero lines, inquiry subtitle, stepper, wrapped
  buttons, text escaping its button/link (new), Moloch, "OUR CLIENTS", Light/Night CTA colours, broken images,
  page errors: all pass (see final run below). Width probes 761–1920 for the immersive titles and the Hats
  cards. Screenshots reviewed: Moloch 768 light / 900 dark, Raida 768 dark / 1000 light, Hats 1024.
  `tsc --noEmit` OK; `bun run lint` 0 errors (1 existing warning, `HeaderJoin.tsx`); `bun run test` 90/90.
  Scripts and shots: `/private/tmp/claude-501/-Users-louchi-Projects-raidguild-integration/90979759-8989-45c7-a420-daa2409cc027/scratchpad/pw/`.
- Not done: Figma comparison (no 768 / 1024 artboards exist yet); October 23 comparison; Safari / Firefox
  (`text-wrap-style` pretty is Chromium and Safari 26+; Firefox falls back to normal wrapping, so widows may
  return there); production build.
- Open question 79: the tablet stacks (immersive copy at 761–899, Hats at 961–1199) are layout decisions made
  to fix collisions; confirm, or supply 768 / 1024 artboards to follow instead.

## November 3 (Figma pass: the owner's edit of "Clients / Light / 1440×900"), uncommitted

- Reference: the owner's export of the edited Figma pilot (`~/Downloads/Clients/Light/1440×900.png`, 2880 × 15214,
  full page). Compared with a 2× capture of localhost at 1440 × 900, light, section by section. Capture artifacts
  ignored (the hero video poster, frozen marquees, alpha masks that did not render: the inquiry scene fade and the
  people card edges); deliberate edits generalized to both routes, both themes, every width:
  - Hero: second title line in the accent pink (Day and Night, both routes); /clients dek reworded with bold runs
    ("**A decentralized collective of builders**, engineers and designers **building onchain products**, …",
    flagged claim, source draft); from 1000 px the copy starts at 10% and ends on the content edge, the dek is up to
    600 px, TRANSMISSION 001 ends on the content edge; from 1360 px the actions sit on the dek's row pushed right
    (24 px gap) and the floor padding is 106 px so the title stays at 567 px; action labels never wrap.
  - Builder network (shared): title and intro (18 px, 17 em) in a column centred on the art (440 px, 31vw from
    1000 px, 34vw on tablets, inset ≤ 64 px); the "Build with the Guild" / "Meet the Guild on Portal" link moved to
    the skill tabs' row (right; its own row, right-aligned, when the tabs wrap; under them on phones). Markup change
    in `BuilderNetwork.tsx`; keyboard order tabs → link.
  - FAQ (both routes): the approved, previously unused foundry portrait (`Ilus_03.png`) beside the list from 1000 px
    (list 690 px at 1440, art ≤ 500 px, decorative, aria-hidden); hidden below 1000 px.
  - Case-study name: 30 px max (was ~45 at 1440), still fitted to the copy column.
  - Spacing from 761 px: case studies and FAQ top 0.7 × `--section-space`; builder network top 0.18 ×, its bottom
    and the next module's top 0.33 × each. Phones unchanged.
  - Services & capabilities: already the horizontal card gallery on both routes; unchanged (matches the artboard).
- Files: `venture.module.css` (hero and spacing blocks appended), `audience.module.css`, `gallery.module.css`,
  `showcase.module.css` (appended blocks), `sections/BuilderNetwork.tsx`, `sections/Faq.tsx`, both audience pages,
  `lib/narrative/clients.ts`, `lib/data/illustrations.ts` (comment).
- Checks: 20 states (2 routes × 2 themes × 1920/1440/1024/768/402): no horizontal overflow, broken images or page
  errors; hero title lines, action labels, FAQ questions and the network link each on one line; actions inside the
  viewport; no overlap between the network title/intro and its art; FAQ art loaded from 1000 px; keyboard (tabs
  arrows → Tab to the link; FAQ Enter opens) with reduced motion. `bun test tests/narrative.test.mjs` 40/40,
  `tsc --noEmit` OK, eslint on the changed TS/TSX OK. Visual comparison against the artboard at 1440 light only
  (/clients); other states checked for layout, not compared to a reference (none exists). Not compared against the
  October 23 reference.
- Round two (owner, same session): questions 75–78 settled. "OUR CLIENTS" alone at 1.19 × `--head-bottom` (44 px at
  1440; 28.6 px on phones, one line); FAQ head at 0.4 × `--section-space` from 761 px (46 px at 1440; the art's top
  overhang matched to it); foundry portrait retouched (stray mark removed, `docs/asset-provenance.md`); the new
  /clients dek approved by the owner (now `approved(…, "owner-approval")`, no review flag).
- Light UI dark contrast (owner): every dark contrast element in Day uses `--color-dark-green` (#102D2C), never the
  navy family. Day-scoped block at the end of `venture.module.css`: CTA edge, icon disc, secondary label and edge
  (so the switches, builder tabs and form controls follow, in every state); the Guild prologue, roster and
  narrative headings, the navy outline pill; builder/steward card edge shadow and selected edge, name and mark;
  the creed scrim; the phone hero floor (≤ 760 px, was navy). Coral surfaces (Moloch, `feature.module.css`) and the
  primary CTA label keep the green-black on-pink ink #071C1D (dark green on coral is 3.9:1). `globals.css`: the
  Discord channel menu edge. Night unchanged (its tokens keep navy; the icon disc stays #12163B).
  Scoped to the audience routes (`.site[data-audience]`, `[data-audience] .moloch`, `html:has([data-audience])` for the
  menu portal): "/" keeps its navy (checked: its prologue title and outline pill still #191E4E).
- Checks (round two): navy audit (computed colour, background, border, outline, fill, stroke and shadows of every
  rendered element) in Day at 1440 and 402 on both routes: 0 navy elements (was 20 kinds on /clients, 48 on
  /community). The 20-state matrix again: all pass; CTA edge/disc dark green in Day, cream/navy in Night. Night
  hero and builder screenshots diffed against the previous run: differences only in animated rows (video, ticker,
  member wall); copy and CTA rows identical. `tsc --noEmit` OK; `bun run lint` 0 errors (1 existing warning,
  `HeaderJoin.tsx`, untouched); narrative tests 40/40.
- Round three (owner): widows and Moloch, `/clients` and `/community`, both themes (end of `venture.module.css`;
  `sections/Hero.tsx`):
  - /community hero (owner, follow-up): the whole second line "BUILD SOMETHING TOGETHER." in the second line's
    style (extended italic bold, coral), one line from 761 px; "FIND YOUR PEOPLE." stays the smaller first line
    (1 : 1.4). Sized to the copy column, leaving TRANSMISSION 001 room from 1300 px: second line 53 px at 1920,
    ~40 at 1440, ~37 at 1024, ~29 at 768. Phones: 18 / 25 px with a break before "TOGETHER." (a phone-only
    `<br>`; one line would need a 15 px second line).
  - Inquiry: from 761 to 1359 px the panel column is clamp(480px, 55vw, 584px) (was half the row), so the
    description stays on one line from a 420 px column (14–16 px). Phones keep two lines.
  - Stepper: titles never wrap; columns sized to content (the wizard's inline equal columns overridden with
    !important); under a 400 px form the number sits above its title (phones). "[ BEGIN A TRANSMISSION ]" no
    longer wraps.
  - Every pill label on the two routes is nowrap ("Create your Portal profile" at 1024 and "Find your path into
    the Guild" at 768 used to wrap); each still fits its container.
  - MOLOCH 1.5 ×: 37 → 55.5 px from 761 px, 36 → 52 px on phones (capped to the column), one line.
- Checks (round three): 20 states, 10 checks each (overflow; hero lines and the joined /community line; inquiry
  description; stepper titles one line and inside the stepper; no wrapped or escaping buttons; Moloch size, one
  line, inside the viewport; "OUR CLIENTS" and FAQ top; panel label; Light CTA dark green / Night cream + navy;
  broken images and page errors): 0 failing. `tsc` OK, `bun run lint` 0 errors (1 existing warning), narrative
  tests 40/40.
- Not changed: the Sync Steward hat's indigo (`lib/data/hats.ts`, a hat colour in the tree, not a contrast
  element); `/chat` (PrismChat, navy page, outside the two routes).

## November 3 (Figma pilot: Clients / Light / 1440×900), no repository changes

- File https://www.figma.com/design/PSwz2c6DpIpSr5pkcdO2u2/Untitled?node-id=7-2 (page "adaptatations"). Frame
  `7:2` "Clients / Light / 1440×900", 1440 × 7607, at x 47 y 1400 under the 1440 template; section `15:2`
  "Components" at x -4600. The five corrected template frames (`1:2`–`1:14`) were not touched.
- Method: Figma's HTML capture (`generate_figma_design`, script injected through headless Chrome; no source edit)
  of http://localhost:3017/clients at 1440 × 900, light, lazy images forced, dev badge hidden, then repaired
  with `use_figma`: 108 Last Duel runs → outlines; 89 CSS-mask icons → 8 icon components; 79 rasters → originals
  from `public/` (3 WebP converted losslessly to PNG: Figma's renderer showed WebP fills blank); 36 logo tiles →
  9 vector components from the SVG originals; Ubuntu Mono italic → upright (the site loads no italic, synthesis
  off); scroll cue rebuilt vertical; hero foreground crop (object-position) applied; ↗ → glyphs set to
  JetBrains Mono (Ubuntu Mono lacks them; Figma fell back to emoji); 3 CSS gradient masks rebuilt as alpha
  masks; layers renamed from the CSS-module class names.
- Result: 671 frames, 322 instances, 186 live text layers, 661 vectors, 84 image fills (no full-page raster),
  0 missing fonts. 82 components: 8 icons, 53 outlined display-type runs, Card / Service (Art=Contain|Cover),
  Card / Builder, Card / Steward, FAQ / Item, Filter / Skill tab, Button / CTA pill (Context=Default|Hero),
  Button / Carousel arrow, Link / Footer, Link / Nav, Ticker / Item, Form / Step, Form / Text field, 9 client logos.
  Each instance was checked against its original layer before the swap (≤ 0.6 px; text positions ≤ 2 px).
- Comparison (Figma render vs the browser at 1440 × 900, light, `/clients`, client audience, same session):
  share of pixels differing by > 64/255 per section: hero 1.9 %, ticker 5.8 %, services 0.8 %, works 2.8 %,
  builders 1.9 %, people 1.0 %, FAQ 0.3 %, inquiry 3.8 %, creed 0.6 %, footer 1.5 % (raw capture: 1.4–9.4 %).
  Remaining differences: the three marquees are frozen at a different animation offset; the hero and creed use
  the video posters; Ubuntu Mono labels measure up to ~2–4 px wider in Figma; noise texture/dot pattern subtle;
  **the alpha masks (logo marquee edges, inquiry scene fade, profession figure fade) do not render in the MCP
  renderers at all, even a solid test mask: not verified, check in the Figma app.** Not compared against the
  October 23 reference (the page has diverged from it by design).
- Not componentized (single use or different structure): header switches, works step buttons, the works
  "Discuss your project" pill, textarea and Discord field. Scratch files (not versioned):
  `/private/tmp/claude-501/-Users-louchi-Projects-raidguild-integration/b5016376-01ac-4b01-a709-c89b0124fdcc/scratchpad/fx/`.
- Open questions:
  72. **Display type in Figma:** the MCP runtime only has Google Fonts (no local fonts), so Last Duel is outlined
      (vector, not editable text). Keep outlines, or enable Figma font access / upload Last Duel to a team (licence,
      question 64) so the runs can be rebuilt as live text?
  73. Approve the pilot (structure, naming, components, Components section placement) before the other 19
      compositions (1920, 1024, 768, 402 × light/dark × /clients, /community).
  74. Marquee/ticker frames: keep the captured animation offset or reset every track to its start position?

## November 3 (preview deploy of the working tree)

- Deployed as a Vercel preview at the owner's request (no commit): HEAD `04da57f` + this session's uncommitted
  iteration (hero seam, "Works", /community capabilities and member benefits), built from a clean copy without
  the owner's uncommitted files (`package.json` yarn `packageManager`, deleted legacy images, `clients.pdf`,
  `LastDuel-Ex2Retalic.otf`). `dpl_Di9vK5qe5LQAgzu4aALNtYd6U8iK`, Ready,
  https://raidguild-venture-beyond-review-9t9eegmg6.vercel.app (Vercel login required). /clients and /community
  200 with the new markers. Review alias and production unchanged. Record and patch:
  `~/Projects/raidguild-backups/2026-11-03/`. The deployed code is not in any commit yet.

## November 3 (community restructure): builder-side capabilities, separate member benefits (uncommitted)

- /community "Ideas into working systems" no longer reuses the /clients gallery content: new
  `communityCapabilities` (`src/lib/narrative/community.ts`), the same six capabilities and art, framed for
  builders. Titles: Ship on / real raids; The onchain / practice; The applied AI / practice; Make it /
  understandable; Carry the / Guild's voice; Shape how / the Guild runs. Bodies reuse page copy (handbook raid
  claim, practice copy, stewardship intro) plus two flagged drafts (Design, Coordination). Links: handbook
  (raids, DAO operations), the two practices, Portal field notes, `#work`. CTA "Explore the Guild" → `#guild`;
  footnote "Not sure where you fit? Ask our AI CTO" → `/chat`. No inquiry or client language.
- Member benefits: own component `sections/MemberBenefits.tsx` + `benefits.module.css` (gallery surface and
  heading, compact layout): numbered cards with a small square of art; 2 columns from 700 px (art beside the
  copy from 1000 px, beside the label below), a stack on phones; no scroll row or controls. Heading now "Why
  builders / join the Guild" (flagged). Height: 1440 1030 → 738 px; 768 927 → 814; 393 885 → 1226 (the
  scrolling row became the requested stack).
- `/clients` unchanged. `src/app/(venture)/community/page.tsx` wires both; `tests/narrative.test.mjs` adds a
  test (six capabilities, same art, no inquiry/client wording, CTA → guild).
- Checks: section shots at 1440/768/393 × Light/Dark for /community (both modules) and /clients (services),
  plus 360/700/1000/1920: no overflow, broken images, page errors or wrapped/overflowing card titles; gallery
  links listed and the CTA lands on `#guild`. Narrative tests 40/40, `tsc` OK, eslint on the changed files OK.
  Not compared against the October 23 reference. Figma export not started (by request).
- Open question 71: approve the builder-side card titles, intro, link labels, the two draft bodies and the
  benefits heading; confirm "How raids work" / "How the DAO works" handbook pages are the right destinations.

## November 3 (hero layer seam, nav label): uncommitted, on top of `04da57f`

- Hero seam (/clients and /community, both themes, from 1000 px): the curtain foreground (cloaked figures and
  plants) ended at the title's top, where the floor is only ~72% opaque, leaving a hard horizontal cut. It now
  shares the art's box (hero top down to `--hero-bleed` under the title, where the floor is solid); same top
  edge, same scale, and the image keeps its old vertical offset (computed with container units), clamped only
  at about 1000–1100 px, where its framing moves down by at most 29 px. Below 1000 px the foreground already
  overhung the floor (no seam); phones untouched. `src/components/venture/venture.module.css` (appended block
  "Hero layer seam").
- /clients navigation: "Previous works" → "Works" (owner request), same link (`#case-studies`).
  `src/lib/narrative/clients.ts`. /community has no such item.
- Checks: hero metrics at 393/768/1024/1440/1920 × both routes × both themes unchanged (heights, title lines,
  CTAs, ticker), no horizontal overflow, no page errors; the luminance jump at the old seam row now sits below
  the art's normal row-to-row texture at every desktop/tablet state; nav link checked at 1440 (bar) and
  900/768/393 (menu), both themes, lands on `#case-studies`. `bun test tests/narrative.test.mjs` 39/39,
  `tsc --noEmit` OK. Not compared against the October 23 reference (the hero has diverged from it by design).

## November 2 (Figma reference export, no code changes)

- Figma: the local server at http://127.0.0.1:3845/mcp is the Figma desktop app's Dev Mode MCP server (running,
  answers `initialize`); its tools are read-only (`get_design_context`, `get_variable_defs`, `get_screenshot`,
  `get_motion_context`, `get_metadata`, `get_figjam`), so it cannot create frames or place images. Frames were
  not created in Figma.
- Fallback export (scratchpad, not versioned): `scratchpad/figma-export/` with `<Route>/<Theme>/<Size>/` folders
  for Clients and Community × Light / Dark × Desktop 1440 / Tablet 768 / Mobile 393 (12 states, 202 PNGs at 1×):
  full page, full page in ≤ 4000 px parts, and one slice per section; `INVENTORY.md` (section number, name,
  anchor, heading, y / height per size) and `manifest.json`. Interactive states are at rest.

## November 2 (galleries and FAQ): services and member-benefit galleries, buyer / member FAQ (uncommitted)

Decision record: `docs/venture-integration.md` ("November 2, galleries and FAQ").
- One shared component, `sections/FeatureGallery.tsx` + `gallery.module.css`: a focusable horizontal scroll
  region (snap per card, arrow keys, swipe) with previous / next sword buttons (disabled at the ends, instant
  with reduced motion); cards = artwork, category label, two-level title (Retalic over extended italic, each line
  fitted to one line), Ubuntu body, optional text link. Content types `FeatureGalleryContent`, `GalleryCard`.
- /clients: services gallery right after the hero (`id="spears"`, keeps the "services" / "capabilities"
  anchors): six cards, the five published services (bodies unchanged, still flagged) plus "Smart contracts,
  onchain systems" (the Onchain practice copy and link); Applied AI links to its practice. Heading "What we can /
  build for you" (brief framing, flagged). The services accordion (`Services.tsx`, `services.module.css`) is
  deleted; previous works now follow the gallery.
- /community: member benefits gallery right after the hero (`id="benefits"`, celeste in Day, deep navy in Night):
  Cohorts, bounties and raids; Hackathons and hackerhouses; RIPs and shared funding; Guild email and Linktree
  ($20 a month). All draft copy, flagged as claims. "Ideas into working systems" uses the same gallery with the
  service cards (it replaces the accordion and the practices disclosure).
- FAQ (`sections/Faq.tsx`): question headings (h3) with disclosure buttons. /clients before the inquiry, the
  brief's six questions; /community before Join, five questions answered only with existing community copy.
- Content placeholders (unresolved, shown as dashed "to be confirmed" marks, never as facts): cost
  `[$X–$Y]`; duration `[X–Y weeks]`, `[X days]`; payment `[fiat / USDC / both]`, `[entity / agreement]`. Every
  clients FAQ answer is flagged for confirmation. Also unconfirmed: the $20 / month Guild email + Linktree price,
  how RIPs and funding work, cohort / bounty / raid / hackathon wording, the card category labels.
- Validation (focused, 10 cases, dev server): /clients 1440 light, 1440 dark, 375 light, 900 dark; /community 393
  dark, 1440 light, 768 light; keyboard; reduced motion; regressions (hero, builders wall and tabs, inquiry,
  Join scene, nav targets). All: overflow 0, broken images 0, console errors 0, no failed requests (videos'
  aborted ranges and dev Analytics excepted), card titles one line each, galleries scroll, next / previous work.
  Typecheck passes; tests 88/88 (3 new); lint 0 errors (1 old warning). Not run: the full browser matrix,
  Safari / Firefox, devices, production build.
- Screenshots: `scratchpad/pw/shots/gx/`.
- Later (owner): /community order swapped: the services gallery ("Ideas into working systems") now follows the
  hero and the member benefits gallery follows Join. Every sword arrow is turned 180° so the hilt leads like an
  arrowhead (new `public/images/icons/arrow-*-hilt.svg`, the owner's five arrows rotated; originals untouched;
  masks in `venture.module.css`).

## November 2 (hero desktop pass): more scene, two-line title, Day/Night floor (uncommitted)

Phones (≤ 760 px) are the approved reference and unchanged: every rule is in a `min-width: 761px` (or wider)
query in the "Hero, desktop and tablet" block at the end of `venture.module.css`; the shared floor rules only
gained colour variables with the same Night values. Measured unchanged at 375 / 393 (scene 450 / 448 px
/clients, 374 / 369 /community; same title sizes, copy positions, CTA rows and cream text in both themes).

Desktop / tablet, /clients and /community, both themes; hero height unchanged (800 px at 768 / 900, 860 px at
1440 / 1920):
- More scene: the actions sit side by side from 761 px; from 1360 px the dek and the actions share one row
  under the title; floor bottom padding 80 px; the art bleeds 56 px under the title's first line, where the
  200 px fade ends. Scene height (art box) /clients: 768 → 539 px (was 373 at 900 / 473 at 1440 before), 900 →
  523, 1440 / 1920 → 619 of 860. /community: 768 / 900 → 463, 1440 / 1920 → 564.
- Title: two lines, nowrap, measured one row each at 768 / 900 / 1440 / 1920. /clients "HARD PROBLEMS," is
  1 / 1.15 of "WORKING PRODUCTS" here (47 / 54 px at 1440, 36.4 / 41.9 at 768); phones keep 1.16 ×. /community
  keeps its approved three-line stacked title (38 / 38 / 53 px).
- Floor: Night navy (#191E4E) with cream text, as before. Day: cream (#EFE9D7) with a soft celeste glow
  (#B8E0DF), the art fading into it, and all hero text in the Light UI dark green (#102D2C): title (h1 and its
  lines), dek, TRANSMISSION, scroll cue. CTAs keep the shared tokens (pink primary, cream secondary with its
  navy edge).
- TRANSMISSION 001: from 1300 px on the floor, level with the title, right of it; 761–1299 px at the scene's
  lower right (20 px above the floor), with a cream halo in Day. It no longer meets the actions.
- Contrast (text pixels vs what is behind them, worst 10%): title ≥ 8.7:1 Day, ≥ 11.5:1 Night; marker ≥ 8.6:1
  Day, ≥ 6.4:1 Night, at 768–1920.

Validation: `bunx tsc --noEmit` passes; `bun run test` 85/85; `bun run lint` 0 errors (1 old warning,
`ThemeAnchor`). "/", /clients, /community × light/dark × 375/393/768/900/1440/1920: overflow 0, console errors
0, layout shift 0 except "/" dark 1440 (0.0006, as before) and 1920 (0.0003; "/" is untouched); 0 Grinder;
failed requests are the videos' aborted range requests and the dev-blocked Analytics script. Spill check 0 at
the six widths; CTA audit 0 at 375 / 393; no CTA / marker / title collisions (geometry check). Reduced motion:
same layout (nothing new animates). Not verified: Safari / Firefox, devices, production build.
Screenshots: `scratchpad/pw/shots/d3/{clients,community}-{375,393,768,900,1440,1920}-{light,dark}.png`,
reduced motion `shots/d3rm/`, sheet `shots/d3/s-final-wide.png`.

## November 2 (hero experiment): scene above, copy on a solid navy floor; Last Duel case-study names (uncommitted)

Decision record: `docs/venture-integration.md` ("November 2, hero experiment"). /clients and /community, both
themes, all widths; "/" unchanged. Implementation: "Hero experiment" block at the end of `venture.module.css`.

- Hero height unchanged (780 px phones, 800 px at 761–999, `min(860px, 100svh)` above). The stage is a two-row
  grid: the copy's own height at the bottom, the scene above. Art, wash, moons and curtain foreground are placed in
  the top row (absolutely positioned grid items, rows spelled `1 / 2` because an `auto` end line means the stage's
  edge), so `object-fit: cover` re-frames the art into the shorter box: cropped, never stretched. The phone videos
  are landscape (≈ 1440 × 620), so the shorter box shows more of the scene than before (less zoom).
- Floor: the stage's `::after`, solid #191E4E (both themes) with a soft #303675 glow behind the copy, fading in
  over the last 96 px (phones) / 160 px of the scene; above the foreground, below the copy. The wash only darkens
  the top, under the navigation.
- Measured scene / floor split: 1440 → 473 / 379 px (/clients), 400 / 452 (/community); 900 → 373 / 427 and
  321 / 479; 393 → 448 / 332 and 369 / 411.
- Eyebrows removed from both audience heroes ("Venture Beyond · Hire the DAO" and "[ THE GUILD ]", with their
  dots): `eyebrow` is optional in `HeroContent`; `Hero.tsx` renders it only when present ("/" keeps its own).
- /clients title: "HARD PROBLEMS," at 1.16 × the size of "WORKING PRODUCTS", so the two lines are the same width
  (852 / 859 px at 1440, 332 / 335 at 393). Faces unchanged (Retalic top, extended italic bottom); the size ratio
  is inverted for this hero (open question 70).
- From 1000 px the two actions sit side by side; below, stacked full width. The copy keeps the 12% left column
  from 1000 px, clear of the vertical "SCROLL TO DESCEND" cue.
- Case-study names (/clients showcase, owner request): Last Duel Bold (`LastDuel-BoldEx2`, upright) instead of
  Ubuntu, fitted to the copy column (`min(49px, 100cqi / 10.6)`) so "HYPERCERTS" stays on one line
  (`showcase.module.css`). Description and links stay Ubuntu.

Open questions (new):

70. **Hero experiment:** keep it? Also confirm removing the /community eyebrow ("[ THE GUILD ]"; the brief named
    the /clients one) and the inverted title size ratio on /clients (top line 1.16 × the bottom line).

## November 2 (mobile pass): phone heroes, one CTA object, entity squares, filters, Hats, Join, creed (uncommitted)

Decision record: `docs/venture-integration.md` ("November 2, mobile pass"). Phones (≤ 760 px unless noted), "/",
/clients, /community, both themes. Desktop is unchanged.

- **Top bar** (audience routes, ≤ 699 px): one 16 px gutter on both sides (was 8 px); logo, audience switch and
  theme switch all 52 px, centred on one line; the menu's lines end on the theme switch's right edge. The
  switch's links tighten below 381 px (and gaps to 4 px below 371 px) so the bar fits at 360.
- **Heroes** (/clients, /community): eyebrow + headline at the top (from 148 px), dek + both actions grouped at
  the foot (ending 64 px above the hero's bottom, above the ticker); the artwork shows between them (≈ 210–270 px
  at 375 / 393). Hero height `clamp(640px, 100svh, 780px)` so the actions stay above the fold on short phones.
  /clients eyebrow: a no-break space ties "·" to "Beyond" (`src/lib/narrative/clients.ts`), so it breaks as
  "VENTURE BEYOND ·" / "HIRE THE DAO" (balanced) instead of starting a line with "·". Text unchanged.
- **CTAs, one object** on every route: full column width, 52 px, 26 px radius, 40 px icon disc inset 6 px
  top / bottom / right (was 6–8 px vertical, 10 px right), label 14 px, tracking .06 em, one line. Covers
  `.pill` and the showcase's compact / case-study pills; "Explore all … discoveries" is full width at 52 px
  (`ArtifactGallery.module.css`). No label was shortened: at 375 the tightest ("Create your Portal profile")
  clears its icon by 15 px after the Join panel's side padding went 24 → 20 px (≤ 400 px). Grouped actions
  12 px apart (the Guild pair was 14 px).
- **Queen Raida / Moloch** (≤ 700 px): the 16:9 rectangle cut's centre square (`aspect-ratio: 1`), which holds the
  face / bull head and the travellers; the vertical cut is no longer rendered (kept in `illustrations.ts`).
  Copy 28 px below on the same surface. Moloch heading: "MOLOCH" 22 → 36 px (1.6 ×; 34 px at 375); "TOGETHER
  WE SLAY" grows only as far as it stays on one line (23 px at 393, 1.26 ×). **Sword mark removed** at the
  owner's request (all widths): `titleMark` dropped from `community.ts`, the narrative type, `ImmersiveFeature`
  and `feature.module.css`; `public/images/swords.svg` deleted (tracked, unstaged deletion; restorable from Git).
- **Builder categories** (both routes): two per row across the full column (160 / 169 px at 375 / 393), centred,
  one line; inactive outlined (transparent, 2 px edge), selected filled. The Explore filters are unchanged.
- **Hats tree**: "RaidGuild Steward Admin" is the tree's title node (80 px mark, name 21 px bold; was 64 px /
  16 px), rail and stubs moved to the new centre; "Explore the Hats tree" follows the tree, above the snapshot
  note. The link is rendered in both places, each displayed at its own widths, so focus order = visual order.
- **Join module and Hire inquiry scene** (≤ 600 px): profession group larger (box 34–98 % of the art's height,
  88 % wide; was 44–99 %, 76 %: ≈ 360 px tall at 375, was ≈ 310), and the panel starts 32 px below the group's
  feet (it overlapped them by 40 px). Nothing overlaps the panel, form or buttons.
- **Creed** (audience routes, ≤ 760 px): Last Duel Extended Regular (`LastDuel-Ex2`), upright, centred, no
  back-slant or italic; "BUILD." keeps the coral highlight in Bold Extended, upright. One screen tall (560–720
  px), label / sentence / action one centred group. A soft navy veil behind the group keeps the thinner strokes
  legible: sentence contrast on the art 5.4:1 median, ≥ 3.1:1 for 90 % of text pixels (was 3.1 median, 2.3).
  Documented exception to the two-level display rule; desktop keeps the two-level creed (open question 68).
- **Steward names** (/clients, ≤ 760 px): fitted to the card on one line (`min(24px, 100cqi / 5.6)`);
  "ECWireless" broke mid-word ("ECWireles / s") at 360–375.

Files: `src/components/venture/venture.module.css` ("Mobile pass" block at the end), `feature.module.css`,
`hats.module.css`, `audience.module.css`, `src/components/ArtifactGallery.module.css`,
`src/components/venture/sections/ImmersiveFeature.tsx`, `sections/HatsTree.tsx`, `src/lib/data/illustrations.ts`
(comment), `src/lib/narrative/clients.ts` (no-break space).

Validation (dev server http://localhost:3017, restarted on 2026-11-02 night because it served a stale server
module; Chrome via Playwright, mobile emulation, touch):
- `bunx tsc --noEmit` passes; `bun run test` 85/85; `bun run lint` 0 errors (1 old warning, `ThemeAnchor`).
- `/`, `/clients`, `/community` × light / dark × 375 / 393: no horizontal overflow, no console errors, layout
  shift 0, all font files 200, 0 Grinder, no broken images. Request "failures" are the videos' aborted range
  requests (206 then abort) and the Vercel Analytics debug script blocked in dev (ORB).
- CTA audit (every pill, 360 / 375 / 393): all one line, all 52 px, icon inset 6 / 6 / 6. The only flag is "/"
  "DAY" (the celestial toggle, a false positive: its text is in several spans).
- Spill check (display text, every builder tab): 0 issues at 393, 375, 360, 600, 700, 760. Word-break scan
  (any word split across lines): none on the three routes at 360 / 375 / 393.
- Touch / keyboard: tapping a Hats role selects it, Escape clears; Tab goes from the last role to the moved
  link; arrow keys and taps switch builder categories.
- Font fallback: one glyph, "↓" in "/"'s "Start a Guild inquiry" summary (Last Duel has no arrows), renders in
  Arial. Not in this pass's scope; left as is.
- Kept: at ≤ 380 px "Infrastructure Steward" and "Participation Steward" wrap to two lines inside their Hats
  cards (between words; they wrapped at 375 before this pass too).
- Not compared with the October 23 reference (it predates both the face change and this layout). Not verified:
  Safari / Firefox, real devices, production build, 320 px.

Screenshots (scratchpad, not versioned): `scratchpad/pw/shots/final/` — full pages
`{home,clients,community}-{375,393}-{light,dark}.png` and modules `m-{hero,raida,moloch,filters,hats,join,creed,
stewards}-…png`; before: `scratchpad/pw/shots/before/`.

Open questions (new):

68. **Creed on desktop:** the regular, upright, centred creed applies to phones only (this pass's scope); desktop
    keeps the two-level Retalic / italic creed. Extend it to desktop?
69. ~~Moloch mark~~ Resolved November 2: the owner asked to remove `swords.svg`; the Moloch title has no mark.

## November 2 (hierarchy pass): two-level display headings, bold labels, grouped Guild actions (uncommitted)

Decision record: `docs/venture-integration.md` ("November 2, hierarchy pass"). Supersedes the mapping table in
the migration section below.

| Role | Cut (file) | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Two-level heading, top line | Bold Extended Retalic (`LastDuel-BoldEx2Retalic`, +12°), 700 | every heading's own text; hero `<span>` lines; creed sentence |
| Two-level heading, bottom line | "Bold Extended Italic": `LastDuel-BoldEx2` with synthesized oblique (`font-synthesis: style`, family `--font-last-duel-extended`) | every heading's `<em>`; hero `<em>`; creed "BUILD." |
| Standalone display labels | Bold Extended (`LastDuel-BoldEx2`), upright | TRANSMISSION, hero index "001", section markers (`.sectionLabel`, `.eyebrow`, module `.label`) |
| Display titles that were regular | Bold Extended (`LastDuel-BoldEx2`) | `/` practice cards, Explore gallery h4s, `/` "Start a Guild inquiry"; footer motto (Bold Oblique, italic) |
| Card names (unchanged, see 65) | `LastDuel-Oblique` (italic) / `LastDuel-Ex2` (upright on "/" phones and steward cards) | builder and steward cards |
| Stats (unchanged) | `LastDuel-BoldOblique` | "/" Guild stats |
| Body, UI labels, navigation, buttons, forms | Ubuntu / Ubuntu Mono (unchanged) | |

Wired files: BoldEx2, BoldEx2Retalic, BoldOblique, Ex2, Oblique (five requests per page; BoldEx2 is shared by two
families and fetched once). Not wired: `LastDuel-Ex2Retalic` (nothing sets Retalic below 700 any more).

- Last Duel has no Bold Extended italic file. The bottom lines use BoldEx2 slanted by the browser (Chrome about
  14°): the same width as the top line, slanted the opposite way. Alternative: the BoldOblique file (normal width,
  real italic): one-line change in `venture.module.css` (bottom-line `font-family`), comparison image
  `scratchpad/pw/shots/compare-bottom-line.png`. Open question 67.
- Scale, one ratio everywhere (bottom ≈ 1.3–1.4 × top, "slightly larger"): section headings 28 / 37 px (phones
  18 / ≤24 px, bounded by the widest unbreakable line, "WORKING SYSTEMS"); panel headings (Hire inquiry, Join,
  "/" contact) 24 / ≤32 px (16 / ≤22), fitted to the panel; creed 40 / 54 px (22 / 30); heroes fitted on one line
  per line: /community 38 / 53 px (top ≤ copy column / 15.4 em), /clients "WORKING PRODUCTS" ≤ 54 px with "HARD
  PROBLEMS," 1 / 1.3 of it, "/" "BEYOND" ≤ 80 px with "VENTURE" 1 / 1.35. "MEMBER-GOVERNED" fits its heading at
  every width. Before: tops 30–58 px, bottoms 44–88 px, ratios up to 2.2.
- The thin regular Retalic hero lines and the regular "001" are gone; no large heading stays in a light weight.
  Exception (documented): card names keep their regular weight pending 65; they are not headings.
- Guild module (/community): "Join the DAO" and "Your Guild kit" form one group, 14 px apart (the kit was pushed
  to the row's right edge). Order, alignment (left), stacking on phones (14 px), styles, icons, kit behaviour
  unchanged.
- Grinder: no references left in code or `.gitignore` (its two ignore rules removed); historical mentions remain
  in `HANDOFF.md` (never rewritten), `CHANGELOG.md` and earlier STATUS sections.
- Implementation: a "Display type hierarchy" block at the end of `venture.module.css` (role selectors such as
  `main section h2:has(> em)`, `.hero h1 > span / > em`, `.creed blockquote`, `.contact h2.contactHeadline`;
  `!important` on family, weight, style and size because earlier rules use up to three doubled classes and
  `!important`); marker tokens (`--font-marker`, `--type-marker`, `--tracking-marker`) read by the `.label`
  rules in `hats`, `feature`, `services.module.css`; bold h4s in `ArtifactGallery.module.css`.

Files: `src/lib/fonts.ts`, `src/app/layout.tsx`, `src/components/venture/venture.module.css`,
`src/components/venture/{hats,feature,services}.module.css`, `src/components/ArtifactGallery.module.css`,
`.gitignore` (plus the migration files below).

Validation (dev server http://localhost:3017; Chrome via Playwright; rendered cuts via CDP):
- `bunx tsc --noEmit` passes; `bun run test` 85/85; `bun run lint` 0 errors (1 old warning, `ThemeAnchor`).
- Role inventory at 1440 on all three routes: every top line BoldEx2Retalic 700, every bottom line the extended
  family 700 italic, every marker / TRANSMISSION / "001" BoldEx2 700. Pixel measurement confirms the top lines'
  12° back-slant (it reads subtly on the wide caps).
- `/`, `/clients`, `/community` × light/dark × 1440/393: 0 Grinder elements, all wired files 200, no failed
  requests except the hero videos (as before), no console errors, no horizontal overflow, layout shift 0
  (0.0006 on "/" dark 1440, as before).
- Spill check (display text vs its box, clipping ancestor and viewport, every builder tab): 0 issues at 1440,
  1280, 1024, 900, 768, 600, 414, 393, 375, 360 on the three routes.
- Guild actions: same row 14 px apart at 1440 / 1100 / 900; stacked 14 px apart at 393; order Join → Kit.
- Screenshots reviewed (light and dark, 1440 and 393): heroes on all routes, Builder-owned / Guild, Queen Raida,
  Moloch, Join, Hats, Explore, People, Hire inquiry, creed, "/" sections. Kept: the "/" hero eyebrow wraps to two
  lines at 393 (between words).
- Not compared with the October 23 reference (it predates the face change). Not verified: Safari / Firefox
  (synthesized oblique angles differ slightly by engine), devices, production build, 320 px.

Open questions (new):

67. **Bottom-line italic:** keep BoldEx2 with the browser's oblique (same width as the top line), or use the
    narrower BoldOblique file? Or supply a real Bold Extended italic cut.

## November 2: typography migration, Grinder → Last Duel (uncommitted)

Decision record: `docs/venture-integration.md` ("November 2"); font provenance: `docs/asset-provenance.md`.

Font mapping at the end of the migration (superseded by the hierarchy pass above):

| Role | CSS | File (name table) |
|---|---|---|
| Upright display (`--font-display`, normal, 400) | `--font-last-duel` | `LastDuel-Ex2.otf` (Last Duel Ext Two Regular, width 7) |
| Upright bold (requests of 600+) | `--font-last-duel` | `LastDuel-BoldEx2.otf` (Bold Extended 2) |
| Italic (`font-style: italic`, 400) | `--font-last-duel` | `LastDuel-Oblique.otf` (Last Duel Italic, −12°, normal width) |
| Italic bold (600+) | `--font-last-duel` | `LastDuel-BoldOblique.otf` |
| Retalic (`--font-retalic`, 400) | `--font-last-duel-retalic` | `LastDuel-Ex2Retalic.otf` (+12° back-slant, width 7) |
| Retalic bold | not wired | `LastDuel-BoldEx2Retalic.otf`: no Retalic text asks for 600+, and next/font preloads every registered file |

- The structure mirrors Grinder's (Regular/Italic family plus a separate Retalic family), so every element
  keeps its authored style: upright → Ex2, italic → Oblique, Retalic → Ex2Retalic. `font-synthesis: none`
  stays: 500 renders the 400 cut; 600–900 now render the real bold cuts (Grinder had none, so those requests
  showed regular before): heading lead lines (`font-weight: 900`, e.g. "A WIDE NETWORK", "THE GUILD RUNS ON
  OWNERS,"), the Guild stats, "Start a Guild inquiry" on "/".
- Supporting faces unchanged: Ubuntu (body), Ubuntu Mono (labels, navigation, buttons, forms).
- Grinder purged: `@font-face`/`localFont` declarations and the layout variables removed; `--font-grinder*`
  references replaced in `venture.module.css`, `FrontDoor.module.css`, `PrismChat.module.css` (/chat);
  comments updated; the six unreferenced `public/fonts/Grinder*.woff2` deleted (tracked; restorable from Git).
  Retained on purpose: the `.gitignore` rules for Grinder binaries (they keep stray copies out of Git) and the
  historical mentions in `HANDOFF.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` and earlier STATUS sections.
- Width: the Extended 2 cuts are 25–45 % wider than Grinder, so fitted lines were re-fitted:
  - /community hero, "FIND YOUR PEOPLE. / BUILD SOMETHING": divisor 11.4 → 14.5; 40 px on desktop
    (was 46, which ran past the copy column), about 24 px at 393 (was 30, clipped).
  - /clients inquiry, "YOU'RE BUILDING": `100cqi / 10.3` → `/ 12.8` (it overran its box by 95 px).
  - /community Guild, "MEMBER-GOVERNED": fits the heading width above 760 px (44 px max) instead of
    breaking at the hyphen; phones wrap as before.
  - "/": hero "VENTURE" fits the phone gutters; builder rail names below 1000 px fit per name (`--chars`,
    new on the rail `<strong>` in `TeamWall.tsx`); the five steward names share one fitted size.
- Files: `src/lib/fonts.ts`, `src/app/layout.tsx`, `src/components/venture/venture.module.css`,
  `src/components/FrontDoor.module.css`, `src/components/PrismChat.module.css`, `src/components/TeamWall.tsx`,
  the six deleted Grinder files; new untracked `public/fonts/LastDuel-*.otf` (do not commit, see 64).

Validation (dev server http://localhost:3017, Chrome via Playwright, rendered fonts read through CDP
`CSS.getPlatformFontsForNode`):
- `bunx tsc --noEmit` passes; `bun run test` 85/85; `bun run lint` 0 errors (1 old warning, `ThemeAnchor`).
- `/`, `/clients`, `/community` × light/dark × 1440/393: 0 elements rendered in Grinder; every display element
  in a Last Duel cut; the five wired files load (200) and are preloaded; no failed requests except the hero
  videos (same as before); no console errors; no horizontal overflow; layout shift 0 (0.0006 on "/" dark
  1440, as before). The only system-font glyph in display text is the arrow in "/"'s "Start a Guild inquiry"
  (Last Duel has no →; it sits in an Ubuntu Mono span).
- Spill check, all display text against its box, clipping ancestor and viewport, every builder tab:
  0 issues on the three routes at 1440, 1280, 1024, 1000, 900, 768, 600, 414, 393, 375 and 360.
- Wrapping that changed and was kept (reviewed in screenshots): the creed quote gains a line (3 → 4 desktop,
  5 → 6 phone); footer motto 2 → 4 lines on phones; "A scout for signal." 4 → 5 lines; "Follow your
  curiosity." 1 → 2 (/ and /community, 1440); on "/" at 393 "Keepers of the signal" 2 → 4 and "Specialized
  at" 3 → 4; /clients 393 "What we've built for" and "The Guild runs on owners" 3 → 4.
- Share images (`og/*.webp`, `opengraph-image.png`) are artwork without lettering: unaffected.
- Not compared with the October 23 reference (the reference uses Grinder; the face change is the owner's
  brief). Not run: the October 30 behaviour probes (wall height, form growth, pinned scene; the scratch
  scripts were lost with the temp directory; typography cannot change them: fixed wall height, layout shift
  0). Not verified: Safari, Firefox, devices, production build, 320 px (see 66).

Open questions (new):

64. **Last Duel licence.** 2026-11-02 (night): the owner chose to deploy with Last Duel to the review preview
    anyway, confirming the right to host these files there; the five wired files are committed with the November 2
    work (`LastDuel-Ex2Retalic.otf` stays untracked, unused). Original note: The supplied OTFs are private builds renamed from Adobe's Eurostile LT
    Std 2.035 (`fsType` 4). Their licence field: "PRIVATE / INTERNAL USE ONLY ... No redistribution,
    sublicensing, web hosting or open-source licensing is granted. Renaming does not change the license
    status." Serving them from a public site, or committing them to the public fork, would conflict with
    that. Needs a webfont licence for Eurostile (or an equivalent licensed family) before commit/deploy.
65. **Card names:** the brief asks for Last Duel Regular on card display text. Builder and /clients steward
    names are italic in the approved design, so they now use the Oblique (the italic cut); only cards that
    were upright use Ex2. Switch the card names to upright Ex2 (the existing name fitting has room for it)?
66. At 320 px, "/" ("Keepers of", "Specialized at the applied edge", "starting point.", the legacy form's
    "Let's Get Started") overflows; 360 px and up are clean. In scope?

Previous snapshot: 2026-10-30, afternoon (-0300). **Release `07031e2` is committed, pushed and deployed to Vercel production:**
`dpl_Bz4p12G9bayZT3kdJo41U73PGpGM`, https://raidguild-venture-beyond-review.vercel.app. **The shared CTA system, the
numbered landing-page inventory, the builder module restored to the October 28 editorial grid on a flat
coral plane, the afternoon pass (page container, persistent top bar, Join hero title, Moloch title
with the sword mark, Hats and heading refinements), the final contact module's scene and profession
gallery, the night refinements (foam removed, creed, hero, random gallery, Hire SEO), the CTA icon and pill
system, and the final pass (logo restored, single outline, open form, clues in the footer, section
rhythm)** (sections "October 30" below). Nothing committed, pushed or deployed; the owner
reviews first; the release is now approved for external review.**

Previous snapshot, 2026-10-29, night (-0300). **Iteration 04** (Moloch title, Explore copy, builder layouts by
result count, Hats/Projects swap, CTA states) is committed on `feat/venture-beyond-integration` on top of
iteration 03 (`6ecb1c7`) and pushed to `fork/feat/venture-beyond-integration`. The fork has no Vercel Git
integration (no deployments or commit statuses on any commit), so the push created no preview; it was
then deployed manually as a preview (below).

**Preview of iteration 04 (latest):** `10e1fbf` deployed manually as a Vercel Preview (owner-approved):
`dpl_Hz6aoUMyBBgvCfBHk7sgq2JNNNW3`, https://raidguild-venture-beyond-review-g42gy6tbd.vercel.app (Vercel
login; no alias), clean `git archive`, `--build-env SHOW_REVIEW_FLAGS=false` for that deployment only.
`/clients` and `/community` 200 via `vercel curl`; Moloch title, Explore copy, order, builder tiers and CTA
tokens verified. Record: `~/Projects/raidguild-backups/2026-10-29/DEPLOY-vercel-review-10e1fbf.md`.

Deployments: Production review still release `2bf270d` (`dpl_HqkPYA55qh5V9QHFQpUxwWZ1xjko`,
https://raidguild-venture-beyond-review.vercel.app). Earlier preview of iteration 03 `6ecb1c7`:
`dpl_9RDNQZ5VNvT9hcjDtC5ANj5ho3G8`, https://raidguild-venture-beyond-review-72zh7hv5h.vercel.app (Vercel
login; deployed 2026-10-29 22:18 with `--build-env SHOW_REVIEW_FLAGS=false`, project env unchanged; record
`~/Projects/raidguild-backups/2026-10-29/DEPLOY-vercel-review-6ecb1c7.md`).

Left uncommitted on purpose (the owner's): `package.json` (`packageManager`), the 21 deleted legacy images,
`public/images/casestudies/clients.pdf`, `.DS_Store` files.

**Production verification:** anonymous requests to `/clients` and `/community` return 200; authenticated
`vercel curl` responses contain the new metadata, Moloch title and Join copy.

**Local server:** http://localhost:3017 is running (`bun run dev --port 3017`, restarted 2026-10-30
afternoon because it kept serving a stale narrative module); `/clients` and `/community` return 200.

Next priority at that snapshot: collect external feedback on the published October 30 release. The remaining local-only
files are intentionally excluded from the release: `package.json`, the 21 deleted legacy images,
`public/images/casestudies/clients.pdf`, and `.DS_Store` files.

Previous next priority was: release of the October 30 work (all uncommitted, sections below): commit, push and
Vercel publish once approved; the owner's new files it references must be committed with it
(`public/images/swords.svg`, `public/images/neo/join-*-{light,dark}.png`, `public/images/professions/`,
`public/images/icons/favicon-moloch.png`, the new `public/images/icons/*.svg` incl. `ico_telegram.svg`). Section reordering uses the numbered inventory below, in a later
iteration. Promoting iteration 04 to production still needs approval.

### Approved visual baseline

- Compare only against the exact commit `40f3910`, using a clean, isolated worktree or a
  `git archive` export.
- Its checkout has uncommitted artwork changes:
  - a modified `public/images/queen-raida/queen-raida-reference.png`
  - an untracked `queen_raida_reference_vertical.png`
- **Never reset, clean, stash or discard changes in that checkout.**
- The **October 27 Hire the DAO designs** supersede this baseline for the `/clients` hero,
  ticker, client showcase and Services only:
  - `~/Desktop/Hire DAO Dekstop.png`
  - `~/Desktop/Hire DAO Mobile.png`
- The before-state is the Vercel captures of 2026-10-27 15:27 and 15:31 in `~/Downloads`
  (`screencapture-raidguild-venture-beyond-review-vercel-app-clients-*`).
- **The design files are not 1:1 with CSS pixels.** Measured against elements whose CSS size
  is fixed (the hero CTA pill, the nav pill and the audience switch):
  - The desktop design is a ~1600 px-wide layout at 1.8 image px per CSS px (2880 px wide).
  - The mobile design is a ~393 px layout at ~1.62 image px per CSS px (measured on its
    CTA pills), on a 714 px canvas. It is not internally consistent: its headings and body
    copy extend across the full canvas, which would imply about 441 px. Mobile sizes are
    calibrated to the 393 px reading and capped to fit the screen.
  - Measure future comparisons at those scales.

### Deployed review

**2026-11-03, Production of the review project (latest):** commit `233777b` (the November 3 iteration Tae
reviewed as preview `dpl_Di9vK5qe5LQAgzu4aALNtYd6U8iK`, plus a redirect of `/` to `/clients` scoped to
raidguild.estudioblanco.org), owner-approved, not pushed. `dpl_8BmqYkt7ykpEw5NFZmgm2kKCiqdD`, Ready, aliased to
https://raidguild-venture-beyond-review.vercel.app (public; `/`, `/clients`, `/community` 200). Clean copy checks:
frozen install, tsc, tests 89/89, lint 0 errors, build; the host redirect tested locally. Domain
`raidguild.estudioblanco.org` added to the project (ownership verified); **pending the owner's Cloudflare change**
(remove the redirect to Railway; `raidguild` CNAME to Vercel, DNS only). raidguild.org not touched. Rollback:
promote `dpl_HqkPYA55qh5V9QHFQpUxwWZ1xjko`. Record: `~/Projects/raidguild-backups/2026-11-03/`.

**2026-11-02 23:38 -0300, preview only (latest):** commit `04da57f` (November 2 iteration) as a Vercel
**Preview** deployment of `raidguild-venture-beyond-review`: `dpl_HvV74WQ9m3QJ2CmCTNJ61VrRJVYP`,
https://raidguild-venture-beyond-review-pwdo8qke8.vercel.app (needs a Vercel login; review flags on, as on every
preview). From a clean `git archive 04da57f` (`~/Projects/raidguild-backups/2026-11-02/deploy-04da57f`, plus the
review project's `.vercel/project.json`; no `.env*`), Vercel CLI 65.8.0 (npx cache). The verified twin
(`verify-04da57f`) passed `bun install --frozen-lockfile`, tsc, tests 88/88, lint 0 errors and
`SHOW_REVIEW_FLAGS=false bun run build`. Checked through `vercel curl`: `/clients` and `/community` 200 with the
galleries, FAQ and Last Duel files. **The review alias (https://raidguild-venture-beyond-review.vercel.app) was not
changed** (owner: preview only); it still serves the October release. Hosting the Last Duel files on the preview
follows the owner's decision of 2026-11-02 (open question 64). Note: `deploy-04da57f.log` in that folder.

Earlier (October 28 release):

Source: `~/Projects/raidguild-backups/2026-10-28/DEPLOY-vercel-review-2bf270d.md`, which
follows the procedure in `DEPLOY-vercel-review-da9165b.md` (same folder).

- `raidguild-venture-review` is a separate October 23 deployment, untouched (last updated
  2026-10-24).
- `raidguild.estudioblanco.org` has not been redirected to the new project. On 2026-10-28 04:23
  UTC it still returned 302 to `raidguild-website-redesign-production.up.railway.app`.
- Not changed: raidguild.org, Cloudflare, Railway and `origin`.

## October 30 (release pass): Guild CTA order; release candidate (uncommitted)

Decision record: `docs/venture-integration.md` ("release pass"). Files: `sections/GuildPrologue.tsx`,
`venture.module.css` (Guild CTA row).

Validation (dev server, final focused run before release):
- `bunx tsc --noEmit --incremental false` passes; `bun run test` 85/85; `bun run lint` 0 errors (1 old
  warning, `ThemeAnchor` in `HeaderJoin.tsx`).
- `gorder.mjs` (/community at 1440, 1100, 900 light/dark; 393, 375): Join the DAO left, Your Guild kit flush
  right (0 px from the row's right edge) on one row; stacked Join → Kit on phones; links unchanged; no
  overflow, no errors. `kit.mjs`: kit opens, Escape / close button close it, focus returns, reduced motion.
- Regression: builders audit 480 cards / 0 failures (dark rest #191E4E, selected #303674); wall height stable
  at all 12 route/width combinations; route titles and WebP share images served (150 / 111 KB, 200); form:
  no own heading, one-line description at 1920/1440, stepper, no duplicate step heading, picker and
  validation; Builders/People/Hats selection family and 115 px joint; scenes pinned (10 cases); form grows
  downward; wall slows on hover; both routes × 1440/393 × light/dark without overflow, broken images,
  failed requests, console errors or layout shift.
- Not run: the full CTA browser suite (`scratchpad/pw/cta.mjs`): its expectations describe the earlier
  system (pink edges, transparent outline pills, white hover labels) and would fail on deliberate changes;
  it needs rewriting before it can serve as a gate. Not verified: Safari/Firefox, physical devices,
  production build (`bun run build` not run in the worktree while dev runs).

Release notes for the commit: include the untracked files the code references (see "Working tree" below);
leave the owner's `package.json` change, the 21 deleted legacy images, `public/images/casestudies/clients.pdf`
and `.DS_Store` files out unless told otherwise.

## October 30 (metadata pass): share images, form intro, card colours, one card family (uncommitted)

Decision record: `docs/venture-integration.md` ("metadata pass"); images in `docs/asset-provenance.md`.

  height, type, alt) and twitter card/title/description/image; /clients → clients-queen-raida.webp,
  /community → community-moloch.webp; both 200 `image/webp` (150 / 111 KB); "/" unchanged.
- `audit-builders.mjs`: 480 cards, 0 failures; dark rest rgb(25, 30, 78) = #191E4E on all 240 dark cards,

  card outside the plane, no name truncated or under 13 px.
- `sel.mjs`: steward cards light hover/focus = cyan + 3 px navy edge; dark = #303674 + 3 px cream edge;
  focus ring; Builders → next 115 px on both routes.
- `dek2.mjs`: no form heading; description one line at 1920 (16 px) and 1440 (15.1 px), two lines at 1100
  and 393 (16 px).

  errors or layout shift; wall slows on hover; scenes pinned; form grows downward; picker, stepper,
  validation, transparent secondaries and Join title unchanged.
- Screenshots `scratchpad/pw/now/fam.png`, `wd.png`, `inq-l.png`.

Open questions (new):
62. Social previews use WebP (as asked). Some platforms (notably LinkedIn) have rendered WebP og:images
    unreliably; a JPEG fallback of the same crop is a one-line change if needed.
63. The /community title, description and share title are drafted copy; confirm or replace.

## October 30 (panel-secondary pass): transparent in-panel secondaries, Join title rhythm (uncommitted)

  icon disc transparent on the panel (bone #EFE9D7 / navy #191E4E and #252A61); label, edge and glyph the
  same at rest, hover, pressed and focus (navy light, cream dark); hover/pressed a 9% / 16% tint; focus
  ring; disabled .5. Join title one line: 47 px (1440), 30 px (393), Retalic 30 / 20 px lead.
- `audit-builders.mjs`: 480 cards, 0 failures; dark surface rgb(48, 54, 116) = #303674 on all 240 dark

  rgb(48, 54, 116); one surface, edge, radius and colour set per theme; hover/focus marks 32–40 px.
- `stable.mjs` (both routes at 1440, 1100, 900, 768, 393, 375 × six tabs): module height and the next
  module's offset identical across tabs at every width; no card outside the plane; no truncation.
- `sel.mjs`: steward and Hats cards: hover/focus/selected = 3 px edge, surface unchanged, no transform, no
  dimming; focus ring; Escape clears; Builders→next gap 115 px on both routes.
- `aboutyou.mjs`: no duplicate step heading; stepper "About you"; first label 14 px under the stepper.
- `final.mjs`, `wall.mjs`, `comp.mjs`, `grow.mjs`, `dd.mjs`, `guild.mjs`: no overflow, broken images,

(card component block).

Validation (dev server):
- `bunx tsc --noEmit --incremental false` passes; `bun run test` 85/85; lint 0 errors (old warning).
- Builders audit `scratchpad/pw/audit-builders.mjs`: /clients and /community × light/dark × 1440/393 ×
  all six tabs (All builders, Frontend, Smart Contracts, UX/UI, Fullstack, Coordination): 480 card
  instances, 0 failures. Every card: a focusable `<a>` with href, aria-label and new tab; crossed-swords
  mark at 24 px; avatar loaded; name ≥ 3:1, profession ≥ 4.5:1, mark ≥ 3:1 on its surface; name clear of
  the mark; no overflow, no console errors. Hover and keyboard focus (two cards per tab): mark 32 px,
  contrast held, focus ring present. Properties identical across all cards of a theme, except the
  deliberate phone grid variant (stacked layout, 14 px padding, name fitted), which is the same in both
  themes.
- `wall.mjs`: 36 → 11 → 36 px/s (hover slows, never stops); count line screen-reader only.
- `final.mjs`, `comp.mjs` (10 cases), `grow.mjs`: no overflow, broken images, errors or layout shift; scene
  pinned; form grows downward with a fixed top.
- Screenshots: `scratchpad/pw/now/nn.png` (wall light/dark), `gs.png` (grids with a selected tile),

  linked card's mark is the crossed swords at 24 px, 10 px from the top-right corner; selected (keyboard
  focus) = same surface, navy name, #CE1252 profession, 32 px navy mark, 3 px navy edge; selector-to-plane

  light/dark; /community 1440 light/dark, 393 dark, 375 light), sampled at 0/35/70/100% of the section: the
  stage stays at 0, the gallery keeps the same box relative to the stage in every sample (1440: 100,198 /
  584×612; 393: 24,96 / 345×426), only the form moves; correct scene per theme/viewport; viewport covered

- `grow.mjs`: form open, step 2 keeps the top fixed (1440, 393).
- Not run: full CTA browser suite (expectations predate this system). Not verified: Safari/Firefox, devices.

Open questions (new):
58. Dark primary labels: cream on coral is 3.1:1 (below AA 4.5:1). Keep (owner's choice) or use ink labels?
59. The swords' curved crossguard is the strongest shape at 24–28 px; the right/diagonal swords read
    correctly zoomed, but confirm at real size.

## October 30 (final pass, later): pinned contact scene, one-line inquiry heading (uncommitted)

Decision record: `docs/venture-integration.md` ("final pass, later"). Files: `sections/ContactScene.tsx`
(stage wrapper), `sections/GuildInquiry.tsx` (stray class), `venture.module.css` (scene block, sticky
gallery, heading).

- Scene pinned (sticky stage, one viewport tall) behind the inquiry form and the Join panel; released at the
  section's end; no nested scroll. Desktop gallery pinned with it. Heading "YOU'RE BUILDING" on one line.

Validation (dev server):
- `bunx tsc --noEmit --incremental false` passes; `bun run test` 83/83; lint 0 errors.
- `pin.mjs`, scrolling 0–100% of the section and past it: /clients 1440 light step 1 and dark step 3, 1100
  light step 2, 393 dark step 1 and light step 3; /community 1440 dark and 393 light. Stage stays at 0
  (full viewport height) while the form moves up (about 230 px on desktop, about 760 px on phones), then
  leaves with the section; desktop gallery holds at the section padding; heading one line (45 / 36 / 29 px);
  no overflow, no errors. Join at 1440×900 has no travel (it fits the viewport).
- `kb.mjs`, `wheel.mjs`: gallery held while typing; PageDown and the wheel scroll through and past the
  section to the page end without stalls.
- `final.mjs` (both routes × 1440/393 × light/dark): no overflow, broken images, failed requests, console
  errors or layout shift; correct scenes.
- Screenshots mid-scroll: `scratchpad/pw/now/pin-desk.png`, `pin-mob.png`.
- Not verified: Safari/Firefox (sticky inside `overflow: clip` needs Safari 16+), devices.

Open question: 57. The Join heading "INTO THE GUILD." still wraps on phones; apply the same one-line rule?

## October 30 (final pass): logo restored, single outline, form open, clues moved, rhythm (uncommitted)

Decision record: `docs/venture-integration.md` ("October 30, 2026 (final pass)").

- **Logo:** late-night coral/navy logo reverted; the approved bar pill restored, one size larger
  (`venture.module.css`, "Persistent logo").
- **CTAs:** inner rim removed everywhere; one navy outline per CTA.
- **Inquiry:** open by default on /clients (audience routes), no trigger or close link, grows downward
  (`sections/GuildInquiry.tsx`).
- **Clues:** signal and walker moved to the footer on the audience routes (`shell/SiteFooter.tsx`,
  `sections/Creed.tsx`); hunt directions made location-neutral (`UnchartedHunt.tsx`, `PortalOverlay.tsx`).
- **Rhythm:** `--section-space` on every content module; desktop modules at least a viewport tall.
- Already in place and re-verified, unchanged: Builders flat/no particles/Oct 28 layouts, hero copy and cream
  TOGETHER, creed BUILD. highlight, randomized gallery with transmission, theme/viewport scenes, Hire SEO,
  sword/destination icons, page container gutters.

Validation (dev server, 2026-10-30, final pass):
- `bunx tsc --noEmit --incremental false` passes; `bun run test` 83/83; lint 0 errors (old warning).
- `final.mjs`, /clients and /community × 1440/393 × light/dark: no overflow, broken images, failed
  requests, console errors, layout shift (0); no inner rim on any pill; no clue in the inquiry, Join or creed;
  4 clue controls in the footer; correct scene per theme/viewport; no foam, no dots, no text arrows.
- `grow.mjs`: form open on load, no trigger/close/Back controls; Next to step 2 keeps the section and form
  top unchanged (1440 and 393); no errors.
- `secs.mjs`: content modules 115/115 px padding at 1440, 72/72 at 393; desktop modules ≥ 900 px at 900 high.
- `states.mjs`: 16 CTA captures (8 CTAs × 2 themes) with rest/hover/pressed/focus/disabled; sheet
  `scratchpad/pw/now/states-sheet2.png`.
- `logo.mjs`: logo at 1440/393/375 × light/dark: contained pill, "RaidGuild home", href "/", focus ring
  shown; bar fits at 375.
- Not run: the full CTA browser suite (its expectations predate the navy edge and opaque secondaries).
  Not verified: Safari/Firefox, devices; favicon tab not re-checked this pass.

## October 30 (late night): CTA icons, primary/secondary pills, creed highlight, logo (uncommitted)

Decision record: `docs/venture-integration.md` ("October 30, 2026 (late night)"); icons:
`docs/asset-provenance.md`.

- **Icons:** `src/components/venture/primitives/PillIcon.tsx` (new). Sword right / down / up-right by action;
  Discord, Portal (Join's "Create your Portal profile"), handbook (Moloch CTA), RaidGuild logo (Raida,
  showcase, Services). Guild kit toggle: right/left swords. Theme switch: new sun/dark icons. Types:
  `Action.icon` gains "portal", `ImmersiveContent.cta.icon` ("logo" | "handbook").
- **Primary:** coral, navy edge, inner rim, ink label, navy disc + white glyph. **Secondary:** opaque cream
  (light) / navy (dark), contrasting edge and label, navy disc + white glyph. One set of hover, pressed,
  focus, disabled for both.
- **Creed:** "BUILD." on a coral rectangle with cream type.
- **Logo:** larger and contained: navy pill + white sword (light), coral pill + navy sword (dark).
- Files: `primitives/PillIcon.tsx`, `sections/{Hero,GuildPrologue,JoinCTA,ImmersiveFeature,Creed}.tsx`,
  `src/lib/narrative/{types,community}.ts`, `venture.module.css`, `tests/cta-contrast.test.mjs` (rewritten for
  the new system), docs.

Validation (dev server, 2026-10-30 late night):
- `bunx tsc --noEmit --incremental false` passes; `bun run test` 83/83.
- CTA states (`scratchpad/pw/states.mjs`, 1440, ×2 crops in `scratchpad/pw/st/`, sheet
  `scratchpad/pw/now/states-sheet.png`): hero primary/secondary on both routes, Moloch secondary, Join
  primary/secondary, creed primary, light and dark. Rest as specified; hover #CE1252 + white; pressed
  #A80E44 + white; focus 3 px dark-green ring + cream halo; disabled .5, not-allowed, no lift; all 56 px;
  glyphs as mapped. Secondaries stay opaque over the hero artwork in both themes.
- Health (`final.mjs`, both routes × 1440/393 × light/dark): no overflow, broken images, failed requests,
  console errors or layout shift; correct scene per theme/viewport; no foam, no dots; no text arrows left in
  any pill icon; creed highlight coral with cream type. Top bar fits at 375 (logo 8–66, switch 77–281,
  theme 287–367). "/" renders without errors.
- Favicon: still linked on every route as `/favicon.ico?favicon.141b0878.ico`; the tab itself was not
  re-checked visually.
- Not run: the full CTA browser suite (its expectations still describe the transparent outline and pink
  edge; it needs updating before it can pass). Not verified: Safari/Firefox, devices.

Open questions (new):
55. The sword arrows' curved crossguard can read as an arrowhead at small sizes (the right sword can look
    like "←"). They follow the supplied files; confirm, or supply a variant with a clearer tip.
56. `public/images/icons/arrow-rleft-down.svg` is spelled as supplied (not `arrow-left-down.svg`).

## October 30 (night): Ideas heading, no foam, creed, hero, random gallery, Hire SEO (uncommitted)

Decision record: `docs/venture-integration.md` ("October 30, 2026 (night)").

1. **Ideas into Working Systems**: second line on one line on both routes (`services.module.css`): 52 px at
   1440 in a 600 px column, about 40 px at 1100, 30 px on phones (container units).
2. **Builder foam removed** (CSS block and `BuilderNetwork.tsx` wrapper); no particles anywhere.
3. **Creed**: "build." cream, weight 400, no highlight, both themes.
4. **Join hero**: "Find your people." / "Build something together." on three lines, "TOGETHER." large and
   cream; 88 px desktop (ends at 717 px at 1440, inside the copy column); phones within the gutters.
5. **Gallery**: shuffled order without repeats; about 1.3 s hologram transmission (channel split, flicker,
   figure-masked scanlines); pauses, reduced motion and the hidden status unchanged; no dots.
6. **Hire SEO**: title, Open Graph/Twitter title and description from the brief; share image and site name
   restated; og:url /clients; noindex kept. /community untouched.

Files: `src/components/venture/{services.module.css,venture.module.css}`,
`sections/{BuilderNetwork,ContactScene}.tsx`, `src/lib/narrative/community.ts`, `tests/narrative.test.mjs`,
`src/app/(venture)/clients/page.tsx`, docs.

Validation (dev server, 2026-10-30 night):
- `bunx tsc --noEmit --incremental false` passes; `bun run test` 82/82.
- `scratchpad/pw/final.mjs`, /clients and /community × 1440/393 × light/dark (8 runs, full-page scroll): no
  overflow, no broken images, no failed requests, no console errors, layout-shift score 0; scene loaded =
  horizontal-light, horizontal-dark, vertical-light, vertical-dark as expected and nothing else; no foam
  element; no dots; creed "build." rgb(239,233,215) at 400 on a transparent background.
- Gallery (`holo.mjs`): transmission frames captured at 1440 light/dark and 393 light/dark; the gallery box
  never changed size; after each change the image is back to the plain foot fade with no filter; three visits
  gave three different orders (0135241, 0321542, 0135423), no immediate repeats.
- Heading and title extents measured (`em.mjs`, `title.mjs`); metadata checked in the served HTML (no
  duplicate og tags; og:image 200).
- Not run: the full CTA suite (not requested). Not verified: Safari/Firefox, devices, social-card previews.

## October 30 (evening): contact module refinement, dark scenes and favicon (uncommitted)

Decision record: `docs/venture-integration.md` ("October 30, 2026 (evening)"); assets:
`docs/asset-provenance.md`.

- **Scenes by theme and viewport:** light/desktop `join-horizontal-light.png`, light/phone
  `join-vertical-light.png`, dark/desktop `join-horizontal-dark.png`, dark/phone `join-vertical-dark.png`
  (`contactScenes` in `src/lib/data/illustrations.ts`). No light art behind Dark.
- **Animation:** 9 s per group, staggered opacity crossfade (out 1.6 s; in 2.4 s after 0.4 s), no slide or
  scale; pauses on hover anywhere in the module, focus in the module, off screen, hidden tab; reduced
  motion: still.
- **Pagination:** dots removed; screen-reader-only status.
- **Light:** scene unchanged; faint cream veil behind the panel (desktop) and a soft panel shadow.
- **Phones:** about 56 px of landscape above the group at 393.
- **Favicon:** `src/app/favicon.ico` rebuilt from `public/images/icons/favicon-moloch.png` (16/32/36 px).
- Files: `sections/ContactScene.tsx`, `venture.module.css` (contact block), `src/lib/data/illustrations.ts`,
  `src/app/favicon.ico`, docs. Form, validation, submission, copy, CTAs, route differences unchanged.

Validation (dev server, 2026-10-30 evening):
- `bunx tsc --noEmit --incremental false` passes; `bun run test` 82/82.
- Scene requests (Playwright, `scratchpad/pw/scene.mjs`): /clients and /community at 1440 light load only
  horizontal-light; at 393 dark only vertical-dark; Night → Day at 1440 adds horizontal-light only after the
  switch; 1440 light → 393 → Night → 1440 loads vertical-light, vertical-dark, horizontal-dark in turn, each
  only when shown. No failed requests, broken images, console errors or overflow.
- Gallery (`gallery2.mjs`, `gallery3.mjs`), /clients and /community at 1440 light and 393 dark: first change
  between 8 and 10 s; transitions as specified; held on hover over the panel, on focus in the module, in a
  hidden tab and off screen; no visible dots; status text present; reduced motion: no change in 11 s, 0 s
  transition. Gallery starts 101–112 px into the module (desktop) and 105 px (phones, with the new room).
- Screenshots: 1440 light and 393 dark on both routes, 393 light on /community: no overflow, no errors.
- Favicon: every route links `/favicon.ico?favicon.141b0878.ico` (`sizes="36x36"`, new hash, so caches
  refresh); served bytes match the new ICO; in Chrome after a hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R, via the browser
  extension) the page links the new URL, which returns the new 3-image ICO. The tab strip itself could not
  be captured: **visual tab icon not verified by the agent**.
- Not run: the full CTA browser suite (not requested). Not verified: Safari/Firefox, devices.

Open questions (new):
54. The unlinked legacy icon files in `src/app` (`favicon.svg`, `favicon-96x96.png`, `apple-touch-icon.png`,
    `site.webmanifest` named "MyWebSite") are pre-existing; an Apple touch icon needs a larger source.

## October 30 (late afternoon): final contact module scene and profession gallery (uncommitted)

Brief: the owner's contact-module brief and mockups (`~/Desktop/Screenshot 2026-10-30 at 11.50.20 AM.png`
to `11.57.25 AM.png`). Decision record: `docs/venture-integration.md`; assets: `docs/asset-provenance.md`.

- **Assets integrated:** `neo/join-horizontal-light.png`, `neo/join-vertical-light.png`, the six
  `professions/*.png`. Not placed: `icons/favicon-moloch.png` (question 52).
- **Shared:** `sections/ContactScene.tsx` (`ContactScene`, `ProfessionGallery`) in `JoinCTA.tsx` and
  `GuildInquiry.tsx` (audience routes only). Data: `contactScenes`, `professions` in
  `src/lib/data/illustrations.ts`. Styles: end of `venture.module.css`.
- **Backgrounds:** horizontal cut above 760 px, vertical on phones; capped at 1760 px; cropped from the
  bottom. **Gradient:** scene foot fades over 42%, sides over 120 px when capped; groups fade over their
  lowest 14%; masks only, no added height, panel opaque.
- **Light / Dark:** light scenes in Light; Dark keeps the navy surface (no dimmed light art) until
  `join-horizontal-dark.png` / `join-vertical-dark.png` are added as `contactScenes.dark`.
- **Gallery:** opens on "Druid 2" (the former illustration), 7 s per group, 1.2 s crossfade; waits on
  hover, focus in the module, off screen, hidden tab; stops after a dot is chosen; one-tab-stop dots with
  arrows, 44 × 44 px; reduced motion: still, instant change.

Validation (dev server, 2026-10-30):
- `bunx tsc --noEmit --incremental false` passes; `bun run test` 82/82; `bun run lint` 0 errors (old warning).
- Playwright probe (`scratchpad/pw/gallery.mjs`), /community 1440 light and /clients 393 dark: rotation after
  7 s; held on hover, on focus in the module and with the tab hidden; dots 1 tab stop, 44 × 44, ArrowRight
  selects and announces; autoplay stops after a choice; alt names the group; no broken images, no failed
  requests, no overflow; the inquiry form still opens with focus moved (4 fields). Light loads only the
  horizontal scene at 1440; Dark loads no scene. Reduced motion: no rotation, no transition.
- Screenshots at 1440, 1920 and 393 in light and dark on both routes: no console errors, no overflow; the
  scene is contained at 1760 px at 1920. (One probe error came from the probe's own init script, not the site.)
- The probe found and the fix covers one defect: the gallery inherited `pointer-events: none` from the
  illustration class (hover pause and dot clicks did not work).
- Not run: the full CTA browser suite (not requested for this pass). Not verified: Safari/Firefox, devices.

Open questions (resolved in the evening pass): 52, the icon is now the site favicon; 53, phones now have
about 56 px of landscape above the group.

## October 30 (afternoon): page container, persistent bar, Join hero, Moloch, builder foam (uncommitted)

Brief: the owner's October 30 afternoon brief (16 items), Frames 132/133 (`~/Downloads/Frame 132.png`,
`Frame 133.png`) and the top-bar sketch (`~/Desktop/Screenshot 2026-10-30 at 10.58.21 AM.png`). The
`frontend-design` skill was not loaded in this session; existing tokens and components were used. Section
order unchanged on both routes.

What changed (decision record: `docs/venture-integration.md`, "October 30, 2026 (afternoon)"):

1. **Page container.** `--page-max: clamp(1240px, 78vw, 1500px)`, `--page-gutter: clamp(24px, 5.5vw,
   96px)`, `--page-inline` centres the column. Every section's first content line now starts at the same
   x on both routes: 211 px at 1920, 100 at 1440, 61 at 1100, 24 at 393 (measured; before: 88–476 at 1920,
   80–234 at 1440). The frames are about 1590 px captures scaled to 1920; the formula reproduces the
   owner's guides there (175 px). The hero copy keeps its own position (curtain art in the gutter).
2. **Persistent top bar** (both routes): sword logo → `/`, audience switch, Day/Night switch (two buttons
   in the audience switch's pill, coral when selected), pinned at 16 px on the page gutters; section nav
   scrolls with the header. Phones: logo disc and one theme switch (`role="switch"`), fitting at 375 px
   (logo 8–60, switch 77–281, theme 287–367). `ThemeSwitch` gained `segmented`; "/" keeps the celestial
   toggle.
3. **Shared CTA system**: unchanged from the morning pass; the new theme controls use the same chip
   states and focus ring.
4. **Join hero title**: "FIND YOUR PEOPLE / BUILD SOMETHING" (46 px desktop, about 30 px phones) and
   "TOGETHER" (94 px desktop, 56 px max phones) in pink; within the copy column (173–729 at 1440), no longer
   across the characters. `HeroContent.title.finale` (optional) added; /clients unchanged.
5. **Moloch**: "TOGETHER WE SLAY / MOLOCH" + `public/images/swords.svg` inline (owner's file; the brief says
   `sword.svg`), no "+". Art direction and bottom crop were already shared with Queen Raida.
6. Order unchanged. 7. **Guild Kit** verified, not changed. 8. **Raida/Moloch** copy now on the page
   column; image logic unchanged (shared component).
9. **Hats**: click outside the role cards clears the selection; "Stewards." 21 px / 800 with a 4 px coral
   rule. Layout, tree, cards and typography already matched the brief.
10. **Builders**: plane capped at 1760 px (`--page-wide`), centred, corners round only when capped; grid and
    still wall on the page column; coral foam (blurred forms and bubbles) behind the plane edges; the crew
    illustration added to /community. Angle stays deferred (flat).
11–12. Explore and Join copy already matched the brief (verified, unchanged). 13. Creed "build." already
    coral with navy text in both themes (verified). 14. Heading first lines are weight 900 on every
    section (Explore and the Join/inquiry panels were 400).

Files: `src/components/venture/shell/{SiteHeader,ThemeSwitch}.tsx`, `sections/{Hero,HatsTree,
BuilderNetwork}.tsx`, `src/components/venture/{venture,audience,feature,hats,services,showcase}.module.css`,
`src/lib/narrative/{types,community}.ts`, `src/lib/data/illustrations.ts` (comment),
`src/app/(venture)/community/page.tsx`, `tests/narrative.test.mjs`, `docs/venture-integration.md`,
`docs/asset-provenance.md`, `STATUS.md`. Uses the owner's untracked `public/images/swords.svg`.

Validation (2026-10-30 afternoon, dev server):
- `bunx tsc --noEmit --incremental false` passes; `bun run test` 82/82; `bun run lint` 0 errors (old
  `ThemeAnchor` warning).
- Focused checks at 1440 and 393, light and dark, per change (Playwright, system Chrome): top bar
  positions and theme switching (both controls, `aria-pressed`/`aria-checked`), bar pinned after scroll,
  two-tone focus ring and Tab order (skip, logo, Hire, Join, Day, Night, nav), phone menu open/Escape;
  section edges at 1920/1440/1100/393; hero title line extents at 375–1920; Guild Kit open/Escape/close and
  focus return (also reduced motion); builder plane fit in every category (54 states incl. 1920: plane =
  content + 28 px, cards on the column, no overflow; 24 reduced-motion states: still wall, scrollable
  strip, same fit).
- Full CTA suite once at the end (`scratchpad/pw/cta.mjs`, run 4): **1084/1084** at 1600, 1440, 393 and 375
  px, both routes, both themes (no overflow, no broken images, no console errors, 44 px targets, pill
  geometry, hover/pressed/focus/disabled, identical across themes, reduced motion). Its theme-control rows
  now probe the Day/Night switch (desktop).
- Comparison matrix produced: `/private/tmp/claude-501/-Users-louchi-Projects-raidguild-integration/4717b022-d4f9-4cde-9670-71d41c82afce/scratchpad/pw/cta-matrix-1440.png`
  (39 rows, Light/Dark × rest/hover/focus/pressed; HTML beside it as `matrix.html`).
- The dev server was restarted once: it kept serving a stale `community.ts` (old Moloch title) after edits.
- Not verified: parity with `40f3910` (not compared; these are new owner directions), Safari/Firefox,
  physical devices, screen readers, production build.

Open questions (new):
47. `public/images/swords.svg` is the owner's untracked file and is now referenced: commit it with this
    work (or rename to `sword.svg` as the brief says, then update `community.ts`).
48. Hero copy stays off the page column at 1440 (173 px vs 100 px) because of the curtain art; confirm.
49. "Find your path into the Guild" wraps to two lines at 393 (pre-existing).
50. Footer and /clients inquiry have content reaching the right edge at 393 (−49 px / 4 px, clipped,
    no page overflow; pre-existing, not changed).
51. Explore and Guild keep the Retalic face on their second heading line; the other sections use the italic
    display face. Unify if wanted.

## October 30 (later): builder module restored to the earlier behaviour (uncommitted)

Brief: the owner's recording `~/Desktop/Oct-30-2026 10-04-59.mp4` (16 s): the current light builder module
next to the earlier behaviour (dark), asking to restore the earlier one. Decisions in
`docs/venture-integration.md` (October 30, builders).

**Diagnosis.** The earlier behaviour is the October 28 editorial grid (`2bf270d`): 1–8 results render
`BuilderGrid` (`builderGrid.ts`, a 12 × 3 template per count, card shape by slot: feature, tall, wide,
compact; two columns below a 720 px container); 9+ render the flat three-course wall, moving when wider
than the screen. `a8ff16c` (iteration 02) deleted `builderGrid.ts` and the grid path, so every count became
masonry cards in centred, wrapping courses (iteration 04 tiers 1 / 2 / 3 courses), on a full-bleed coral
plane that `10e1fbf` tilted (`transform: rotate(-1deg)` on `.teamWall`, so plane and cards shared one
transform). Measured before the change: the plane's height already followed the courses (about 30 px above
and below in every category at 1024, 1280, 1440 and 393), so there was no stale height; what read as
empty coral was (a) short lists as small natural-width cards centred in a full-width band, (b) uneven wrapping
at mid widths (Smart Contracts 3 + 1 at 1024), (c) the tilt moving the band edges by up to about 13 px across
the screen, and (d) the recording, which crops a wider window. Root cause of the difference: the editorial
grid's removal in `a8ff16c`, not a height calculation.

**Change.**
- `src/components/venture/builderGrid.ts` restored byte for byte from `2bf270d`.
- `src/components/TeamWall.tsx`: the `BuilderGrid` path restored (1–8 results, masonry modules); 9+ keep the
  three-course masonry wall; the iteration 04 tiers (`data-tier`, 1/2-course rows) removed.
- `src/components/venture/venture.module.css`: the iteration 04 tier block replaced by the `2bf270d` grid
  rules (container query, slot shapes, name scaling) plus opaque tiles on the coral plane (cream / navy;
  hover cyan / #303675 as before). The coral plane is **flat** (tilt removed), wraps the grid or the wall,
  `height: auto` with 28 px above and below (the old 430 px and 340 px wall heights no longer apply); the grid
  keeps the section's content width inside the full-bleed plane; a moving wall still runs edge to edge.
- `tests/members.test.mjs`: the iteration 04 rows test replaced by the restored `2bf270d` grid tests.
- Angle: **removed.** The tilt leant the cards with the plane and made the slack around short lists read
  as uneven; the earlier behaviour is flat. The coral plane itself is kept, flat, hugging the content.
- Unchanged: section order, copy, assets, filters, wall speed (36 px/s), drag, CTA system.

**Validation (focused, dev server).** `bunx tsc --noEmit --incremental false` passes; `bun run test` 82/82;
`bun run lint` 0 errors (old warning). Probe `scratchpad/pw/builders.mjs`: /clients and /community, 1440 and
393, light and dark, all six categories (48 states): plane = content + 28 px above and below in every
state, no transform, no horizontal overflow, grid cards inside the content width (x 86–1354 at 1440, 24–369
at 393), no console errors; with reduced motion (48 states) no moving copy, same fit, no overflow.
Contact sheets: `scratchpad/pw/{clients-1440-light,community-1440-dark,clients-393-light,community-393-dark}.png`.
The full CTA browser suite was not rerun (as asked).

**Open.** (44) The brief's tiers say "5–8: two-row brick layout"; the restored earlier behaviour (the video)
uses the editorial 12 × 3 templates for 5–8 as well. Kept the video's behaviour; a two-row 5–8 variant is a
small follow-up if wanted. (45) On phones the moving wall's names render in a different face from desktop;
not changed in this pass (no diff touches it), not investigated. (46) At 1440 every 1–8 grid is the same
height (three content-sized rows, 348 px), as before.

## October 30: shared CTA system and landing-page inventory (uncommitted)

Brief: the owner's recording `~/Desktop/Oct-30-2026 09-27-22.mp4` (13 s, /community hero; it was not attached
to the message, this is the file of that time on the Desktop) shows the hero CTAs behaving differently in
Light and Dark. Measured before the change (1440, both routes):

| Control | Light | Dark |
|---|---|---|
| Outline CTA, rest | cream fill, ink label, pink border | transparent, white label, cream border |
| Outline CTA, hover | canonical pink, ink label, no ring | canonical pink, ink label, cream ring |
| Filled CTA, hover | #CE1252, cream label, no ring | #CE1252, white label, cream ring |
| Join panel CTAs, hover | cream ring (local override) | cream ring |
| "Your Guild kit" | pink text on the surface (under 4.5:1) | same |
| "Explore all … discoveries" | 1 px outline, no hover | same |
| Explore filters | 24 px radius, 1 px border, pink edge on hover | same |
| Showcase arrows, Hats tree link | pink | pink |
| Theme toggle, hover | darker surface | no change |
| Form Back / Next | 6 px radius, body type; Back hover 8% tint (dark: cream tint) | |

### Landing-page inventory (numbered, English; order unchanged)

`00` is the shared site shell (fixed, not part of the section order). "Shared" means the same component on
both routes; the copy may differ by route.

**`/clients`, Hire the DAO** (`src/app/(venture)/clients/page.tsx`)

| # | Block | DOM anchor | Component | Shared with /community | Interactive controls |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| 01 | Hero ("Find your people / Build something / TOGETHER") | `#top` | `sections/Hero.tsx` (`grouped curtain still`, `title.finale`) | Yes (copy differs) | Filled pill "Explore the community →", outline pill "See what we're building ↓" |
| 02 | Guild Ticker | (none) | `sections/GuildTicker.tsx` | Yes, identical | None |
| 03 | About RaidGuild ("Builder-owned / member-governed") | `#guild` | `sections/GuildPrologue.tsx` (`kitExpander`) | No (also on `/`) | "See more ↗" disclosure, "Your Guild kit →" toggle and panel with close ×, filled "Join the DAO →", outline "Enter Discord", 2 text links |

| 11 | RaidGuild Creed | (none) | `sections/Creed.tsx` | Yes (copy differs) | Filled pill; hunt disclosures |
| 12 | Footer | (none) | `shell/SiteFooter.tsx` | Yes, identical | Same as /clients 09 |

Shared blocks: Header, Hero, Guild Ticker, Builders Network, Creed, Footer, and the Services module (with
different content). Route-specific: /clients Showcase, People, Inquiry; /community About RaidGuild, Queen
Raida, Moloch, Projects & Experiments, Hats Tree, Join. Note: `#stewards` is the People section on /clients
but an anchor inside the Hats Tree on /community.

### Button behaviour decision

One system for both routes, identical in Light and Dark (decision record: `docs/venture-integration.md`,
October 30). The dark theme block no longer redefines any `--cta-*` token.

| State | All variants | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Rest | Filled: canonical pink #EE3C78, ink label #071C1D (4.66:1), pink edge. Outline: transparent, border and label in the surface's text colour. | Chips at rest are outline; selected or open chips are the filled rest |
| Hover | Deep coral #CE1252, white label #FAFAFA (5.25:1), edge kept, 2 px lift | Only under `(hover: hover)`: no stuck hover after a tap |
| Pressed | #A80E44, white label (7.16:1), inset shadow, no lift | Returns to rest on release |
| Focus | 3 px dark-green outline at 3 px offset over a 3 px cream halo | Same geometry and colours in both themes |
| Disabled | Opacity .5, not-allowed, no hover or lift | |

Hover model chosen: the "white text conversion" option on a fixed deep-coral surface, the existing dark
hover. Cream fill and cream outline were rejected: the light theme puts CTAs on cream and light-blue
surfaces, where both would disappear.

Contrast exceptions (by surface, documented in the CSS): (1) light-blue surfaces in the light theme (Join and
inquiry panels, Explore band): dark-green edge instead of pink (2.66:1); (2) coral scenes (Moloch in both
themes, the dark creed): filled buttons rest on deep navy #12163B with a white label, every edge navy.

Applied to: hero, section, compact and creed pills; the inquiry bar; form Back/Previous (outline) and
Next/Complete (filled), now pills in the compact pill type (mono 12 px caps); "Your Guild kit" (chip;
selected when open); the kit close ×; "Explore all … discoveries" (outline); builder and Explore filters
(chips, 100 px radius, 2 px border); the detail view's actions (filled) and back link; the audience switch
(chip; current = selected); the theme toggle; the showcase arrows (icon buttons in the surface colour). Text
links (builders, showcase site, handbook, membership guide, Hats tree, close inquiry): surface colour,
underline 1 → 2 px on hover. Accordions keep their coral row hover; their focus ring is the shared one.
Content cards (builder cards in the moving wall, Explore cards, logo marquee) keep their inset rings
because their containers clip.

Visible consequences to review: the light hero outline CTA is now transparent (was cream-filled); the
Moloch outline CTA is transparent with a navy border (was a filled navy pill); the dark creed CTA is
deep navy (was pink on the pink creed); the showcase arrows and Hats tree link are no longer pink.

### Files changed (uncommitted)

- `src/components/venture/venture.module.css`: tokens; the B3.1 block replaced by the shared system
  (pills, exceptions, inquiry bar, form buttons); form Back/Previous; old ring overrides removed; a closing
  section for chips, toggles, icon buttons, text links and focus.
- `src/components/venture/{audience,showcase,hats,services,feature}.module.css`, `src/components/ArtifactGallery.module.css`.
- `tests/cta-contrast.test.mjs`: rewritten for the shared tokens (dark block defines no `--cta-*`;
  labels, edges and two-tone focus on every surface; coral exceptions).
- `docs/venture-integration.md` (October 30 entry), `STATUS.md`.
- No TSX, copy, data, order or asset changes.

### Validation (2026-10-30, dev server http://localhost:3017)

- `bun run test` 81/81. `bunx tsc --noEmit --incremental false` passes. `bun run lint` 0 errors, the old
  `ThemeAnchor` warning.
- Browser suite `scratchpad/pw/cta.mjs` (Playwright, system Chrome), **1080/1080 on the dev server** (run 2, before the restart and before the builder change below). Covers /clients and
  /community at 1600, 1440, 393 and 375 px in light and dark: no horizontal overflow, no broken images, no
  console errors or failed requests, every visible link/button/disclosure ≥ 44 px; every pill 100 px radius,
  2 px border; filled rest pink + ink (navy + white on coral), outline transparent with border = label =
  surface colour; for 25 control classes plus form Back/Next and the kit close: hover = #CE1252 + white
  (desktop), pressed = #A80E44 + white and back to rest on release, text links thicken without turning
  pink, focus ring 3 px dark green + cream halo; on phones a tap leaves no hover; disabled (pill, filter,
  form button) at .5 and not-allowed with no hover; Tab from the top reaches both hero CTAs with a ring at
  every stop; hover, pressed and focus identical in Light and Dark for every class; reduced motion: colour
  change without lift or transition.
- Run 1 found two defects, fixed: the selected builder filter lost its focus halo (no semantic focus rule in
  `audience.module.css`), and the light theme toggle kept its hover surface after a tap on phones.
- Comparison matrix: **not produced.** The run on the restarted server (run 3), which was to capture
  the crops and assemble the matrix (`scratchpad/pw/compose.mjs`), was stopped when the builder
  iteration below started; its start had already removed run 2's crops. Rerun `node cta.mjs && node
  compose.mjs` in `/private/tmp/claude-501/-Users-louchi-Projects-raidguild-integration/4717b022-d4f9-4cde-9670-71d41c82afce/scratchpad/pw/`
  to produce `scratchpad/cta-matrix-1440.png`. The suite's per-class state values are in run 2's log
  (`scratchpad/pw/cta-run2.txt`); the state table above is what it verified.
- Not run: production build (not requested; dev server only). Not verified: Safari, Firefox, physical
  devices (touch was emulated), screen readers; visual parity with `40f3910` (not compared; these
  controls were superseded by later owner decisions).

### Remaining inconsistencies and open questions

38. **Moloch CTA**: now a transparent navy-outlined pill (the rule for outline CTAs). The owner had
    approved a filled navy pill there; if that look should stay, make the CTA `variant: "filled"` in
    `community.ts` (it would then rest navy with a white label under the coral exception).
39. **Dark creed CTA** is deep navy on the pink creed (was pink on pink, an invisible edge). Confirm.
40. **Accordion rows** (Services) keep a coral text hover rather than the button hover; they are
    disclosures, not buttons.
41. **Header nav links** keep their underline-grow hover; only their focus ring changed.
42. **Hats role cards, builder cards, Explore cards and logo buttons** keep their own hover (content cards);
    the logo buttons' and Hats cards' focus now use the shared ring.
43. **Form buttons** now use the compact pill type (uppercase mono); the labels' copy is unchanged.

Comparison matrix: produced in the afternoon run (see "October 30 (afternoon)" above).

## Design system normalization, iteration 01 (2026-10-29; committed with iteration 02)

References: the owner's October 29 captures of `/clients` and `/community`
(`~/Downloads/screencapture-localhost-3017-{clients,community}-2026-10-29-*.png`, light and dark) and
the Hats app screenshot of tree 1822 (`~/Desktop/Screenshot 2026-10-29 at 5.14.37 PM.png`). Decisions
are in `docs/venture-integration.md` (October 29 entry); the asset manifest is in
`docs/asset-provenance.md` ("Placeholder slots").

| Area | Change |
|---|---|
| Hero | One title scale for both routes (`.heroTitleLong`): lead `min(34px, 8.4vw)` / 46 / 58 px, second line `min(52px, 13.2vw)` / 58 / 73 px (the October 27 design). /community was 34–58 px on both lines. /community keeps its coral second line; /clients keeps its headline-colour line (`.heroTitlePlain`) and the curtain. Copy and video unchanged. |
| Buttons | Dark theme, both routes: white labels (`--color-white`, the brand's #FAFAFA); filled buttons on `#CE1252` (5.3:1; white on canonical pink is 3.8:1) with a canonical pink edge (`--cta-edge`, 4.2:1 on navy); hover adds the cream ring; outline buttons transparent with a cream edge (`--cta-outline-border`). The "Start a Guild inquiry" summary follows. Light theme unchanged. Heights, paddings, radii and icons were already shared (56/52 px pills; 44 px compact pills on /clients). |
| Builder network | /community uses the /clients implementation (`BuilderNetwork masonry`): masonry wall at 36 px/s, adaptive grids for 1–8 results, full bleed while moving, showcase-scale heading. Data, links, filters, reduced motion and the no-duplicates fix unchanged. No illustration added to /community. |
| Capabilities | /community renders "Ideas into working systems" with the shared `Services` module (same accordion, typography, spacing, foundry portrait/horizontal art), keeping its heading, intro, services, "Open a Guild inquiry" and the specialist practices disclosure (`Services practices`). `Capabilities.tsx` is no longer used by /community. |
| Join | `JoinCTA` sits on the /clients inquiry panel (`contactCyan`: light-blue in light, raised navy in dark). Copy, Portal and Discord actions and the membership guide unchanged; no inquiry form. |
| Order | hero → About RaidGuild (`#guild`) → Queen Raida (`#raida`) → Projects and Experiments (`#work`) → the Hats Tree (`#hats`, anchor `#stewards`) → builders (`#team`) → Join (`#join`) → About Moloch (`#moloch`) → ideas into working systems (`#spears`) → creed. Navigation anchors unchanged. |
| About RaidGuild | `communityGuild` restored verbatim from `f842d87` ("Builder-owned / member-governed", body, "See more", "Your Guild kit" with four benefits, the cohort requirement, "Join the DAO" / "Enter Discord", handbook and Queen Raida links). |
| Queen Raida / Moloch | New `sections/ImmersiveFeature.tsx` + `feature.module.css`: full-width art via `<picture>` (desktop horizontal, phones ≤ 700 px vertical, from `getImageProps`), copy below, showcase heading scale, one CTA. Queen Raida: approved heading and body (owner-approval), CTA "Ask our AI CTO" (existing), art `queen-raida-v2.png` / the owner's untracked vertical cut (falls back to the horizontal cut when missing). Moloch: the October 28 copy verbatim, CTA "Find your path into the Guild", placeholder art. Surfaces: Queen Raida `--scroll-100` (light) / `--surface-deep` #12163B (dark); Moloch `--moloch-600` in both themes with cream text and `--moloch-200` accents. No parallax: neither artwork has separated layers. The October 23 Queen Raida carousel is no longer rendered (copy kept). |
| Hats Tree | New `sections/HatsTree.tsx` + `hats.module.css`, data in `src/lib/data/hats.ts`: parent 1822 "RaidGuild Steward Admin" above the five featured roles (Knowledge, Infrastructure, Sync, Participation, Brand), tree connectors, the other four roles listed, a reference-snapshot caption, "Explore the Hats Tree" → https://app.hatsprotocol.xyz/trees/100/1822, DAO Roles and Hats Protocol links. Role cards are buttons (hover, focus, tap or click select; `aria-pressed`; details in a polite live region). Descriptions only for Brand and Sync Steward, quoted from the handbook's DAO Roles page (claims). No wearers or portraits. Dark green scene in both themes; vertical tree on phones. Replaces "Keepers of the signal" (steward roster no longer rendered on /community; still on /clients as People behind the work). The October 28 Hats Tree and stewardship copy moved here verbatim. |
| Dark scenes | /community: About navy, Queen Raida deep navy, Projects raised navy, Hats dark green, builders navy, Join deep navy with a raised panel, Moloch red, capabilities raised navy, creed pink; no two neighbours share a surface. |
| Creed | The coral "build." and the taller mobile creed now apply to both routes. |

Files (uncommitted):
- Modified: `src/app/(venture)/community/page.tsx`, `src/components/venture/{venture,audience,services}.module.css`,
  `src/components/venture/sections/{BuilderNetwork,JoinCTA,Services}.tsx`, `src/lib/data/illustrations.ts`,
  `src/lib/narrative/{community,types}.ts`, `tests/{narrative,cta-contrast}.test.mjs`,
  `docs/{asset-provenance,venture-integration}.md`, `STATUS.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`.
- New: `src/components/venture/sections/{ImmersiveFeature,HatsTree}.tsx`,
  `src/components/venture/{feature,hats}.module.css`, `src/lib/data/hats.ts`, and the seven placeholder
  PNGs in `public/images/venture/entities/` and `public/images/venture/hats/`.

### Verification of iteration 01 (2026-10-29)

- `bun run test` 78/78 (new: About restored, Moloch and Queen Raida copy, Hats content and links,
  tree structure, hat PNG size and transparency, Moloch slot sizes, dark CTA contrast).
  `bunx tsc --noEmit` passes. Lint: 0 errors, the old `ThemeAnchor` warning.
- `SHOW_REVIEW_FLAGS=false bun run build` passes in an isolated copy (no `.env*`); served on 3018
  and stopped afterwards; 0 review ids in `/community`.
- Browser suite (`ds01.mjs`, Playwright): 396/396 on the dev server and on the production build:
  both routes at 1600, 1440, 393 and 375 px in light and dark: shared hero scale, filled-button
  contrast ≥ 4.5:1, white dark-theme labels, light buttons unchanged, every builder filter unique with
  the right count and one accessible copy, adaptive grids, full-bleed masonry wall, no overflow, no
  broken images or failed requests, no console errors; on /community: section order, About restored,
  Queen Raida and Moloch art switching horizontal/vertical, full width, copy below, approved copy,
  Hats parent, five roles in order, four more, connectors, tree link, snapshot label, no wearers,
  capabilities on the Services module, Join panel and actions, distinct dark scenes, Moloch red,
  navigation targets; Hats keyboard focus, hover (desktop) and tap (phone), wall 36 px/s, reduced
  motion (still wall, no transitions); /clients curtain, rotation and inquiry states unchanged.
- Screenshots (side by side, both routes, light and dark, 1440 and 393; full pages at all four widths):
  `/private/tmp/claude-501/-Users-louchi-Projects-raidguild-integration/afb6ffad-2e28-42d6-b989-2be86bcb321f/scratchpad/ds01/final/`.
- Not verified: Safari, Firefox, physical devices, screen readers; live Hats data (the app is
  client-rendered; the tree is labelled a snapshot); visual parity with `40f3910` (not compared:
  these modules are new or superseded by the owner's later references).

## Released: October 28 refinements (`2bf270d`)

The sections below ("Contents: October 28 feedback", "Interaction fixes", "Frame 122", "Frame 123",
"Full-bleed wall and showcase rotation", "/community: Join the DAO iteration") describe what this
release contains, written while the work was in progress; all of it is committed in `2bf270d` and
deployed. Where they say "uncommitted", read "committed in `2bf270d`".

### Verification summary

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Release tree before committing (clean export) | `bun run test` 71/71; `bunx tsc --noEmit` passes; `bun run build` passes; 0 review ids in the prerendered `/clients` and `/community` pages |
| Lint | 0 errors, 1 warning (`ThemeAnchor` unused, `HeaderJoin.tsx:78`), present before this work |
| Production URL, browser suites | general 75/75, rotation and full-bleed wall 66/66, October 28 96/96, marquee 40/40; Frame 122/123 suite: the full 1440 px pass (61 checks) ran, one failure caused by a local DNS outage, which also stopped the run |
| Frame 122/123 suite at 1024, 393 and 375 px | 365/365 on the identical local production build; **not run on production** |
| Not verified | form submission (no backend secrets), Safari, Firefox, physical devices (touch was emulated), screen readers, visual parity of the new `/community` Guild copy |

### Verification of the published review (2026-10-28 22:26–23:40 -0300, production URL)

- `/`, `/clients`, `/community` HTTP 200; release markers present ("Build with us", Tae's Daedalus
  copy, "The Guild runs on owners", "Join our community", "About Moloch", "DAO Roles"); no review
  ids or notes in the HTML.
- New Daedalus button (MD5 `97089d2b…`) and screenshot 200; `clients.pdf` 404; ddls.co, the DAO
  Roles page, join-the-guild, Hats Protocol and Portal join respond 200.
- Browser suites against the production URL: general 75/75, rotation and full-bleed wall 66/66,
  October 28 96/96, marquee 40/40. The Frame 122/123 suite ran its full 1440 px pass, 61 checks,
  all passing except one that failed only because this machine lost DNS mid-run
  (`ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED`), which also stopped the run; its 1024, 393 and 375 px passes were not
  run on production (they passed 365/365 on the identical local production build). Two suites
  needed a longer page-load wait on production (slow image responses from this connection).
- Not verified: form submission (no backend), Safari, Firefox, physical devices, screen readers.

## Contents: October 28 feedback (released in `2bf270d`)

Against the deployed review (`dpl_HeuA2CyFgTtiAtvut1MrQB8ECkbR`, release `da9165b`). References:
`~/Downloads/Frame 120.png` (desktop, 3840 px wide, a 1600 px layout at 2.4×) and
`~/Downloads/Frame 121.png` (mobile, 940 px wide, a 393 px layout at about 2.39×). Decisions are
in `docs/venture-integration.md` (October 28 feedback entry).

| Area | Change |
|---|---|
| Dotted boxes | Root cause: the narrative review flags (orange = claim, purple = wording) and the "13 claims · 13 wording" panel rendered on every local dev server (`NODE_ENV !== "production"`). `reviewFlagsEnabled` now returns false in development unless `SHOW_REVIEW_FLAGS=true`; previews and Railway unchanged. Focus outlines unchanged. |
| Case studies | All nine descriptions are Tae's copy (`tae-brief`); the October 23 archive titles and summaries for DAOhaus, BrightID and Hypercerts are removed, so no project has a title line. Daedalus, Problem, Gitcoin and YieldNest now have descriptions. Livepeer and Pocket unchanged. |
| Daedalus | Link `https://ddls.co` (was `https://ddls.co/`). Logo button and screenshot replaced by the owner in `public/` (byte-identical to `~/Desktop/RG/casestudies/`; MD5s in `docs/asset-provenance.md`). Name stays "Daedalus". |
| People behind the work | Heading "The Guild runs on owners, / not employees." (owner-approval), showcase hierarchy: 34/46 px desktop, `min(22px, 5.6vw)`/`min(34px, 8.6vw)` mobile, coral label, centred on mobile. Intro "These are some of the builders shipping the work. The full network is deeper." transcribed from both frames (flagged as wording until confirmed). Mobile: two columns, the fifth card centred. Members link and data unchanged. |
| Builder network | Illustration up to 450 px (was 360) on desktop, `min(340px, 92%)` (was 280) on mobile. Wall in masonry rows (`TeamWall masonry`): three rows, card width follows each name and title, no truncation; rows balanced by estimated length, cards grow to equal row length so the loop seam stays aligned. Three rows on mobile (was two). Filters, links, drag and motion unchanged. |
| Inquiry | `GuildInquiry surface="cyan"`: panel on `--color-cyan` (#B8E0DF, sampled from the frames) in the light theme with dark-green text, focus ring and hunt clue; dark theme unchanged. Illustration enlarged (`clamp(420px, 40vw, 640px)` desktop, `min(470px, 120vw)` mobile). |
| Creed | "build." coral at every width in the light theme (was dark green below 1000 px); mobile section at least 600 px tall (was about 430). |
| Scope | People, wall, inquiry and creed changes are /clients only. /community and / unchanged (checked: no masonry, people section as before). |

### Interaction fixes (2026-10-28, after the owner's local review)

| Issue | Root cause and change |
|---|---|
| P0 duplicated builders when filtering | Not the data or React keys: `TeamWall` always rendered a second, aria-hidden copy of the cards for the seamless loop, so short filtered lists (UX/UI: Suede, Vika, Chiali) showed every card twice. The loop copy now renders only while one copy is wider than the wall and motion is allowed (measured with a ResizeObserver); short lists sit still and show each builder once. The first copy is the only one in the accessibility tree and tab order. `masonryRows` moved to `lib/data/memberCategories.ts`. Applies to every `TeamWall` (also /community and /), since it is a bug fix. |
| P0 inquiry form opened as a separate dark section | `.contactExpanded` moved the disclosure out of the panel to full width with the dark form shell. With `surface="cyan"` the disclosure stays in the panel column; the panel grows to hold the form, whose shell sits on the panel surface (dark-green text, fields, step pills; errors in `--moloch-600`, 5.6:1; the "About you" heading in the existing `#c92662`, 3.7:1 large text). Desktop: the illustration stays beside the form (sticky). Reveal: 0.32 s fade, off with reduced motion. The form (HireUs, three steps, validation, progress, submission) is unchanged. Closing: the same "Start a Guild inquiry / Close the inquiry ↑" disclosure; values are kept. Dark theme: same layout on its own surface. |
| P1 navigation copy | `clientsNav.cta` is "Build with us" (owner-approval), same `project-inquiry` destination; desktop and the mobile menu share it. Hero CTA, inquiry heading and creed keep "Tell us what you're building". |
| P1 hero parallax | **Not implemented; decision needed.** Measured on a clean export of `40f3910` (port 3019) and this branch at 1440 and 393 px: identical motion. The October 23 approved hero has no layered depth either: the foreground halves move with the page and, from 1000 px, a later rule replaces their transform, so `--neo-fore-y` has no effect; `--neo-curtain-open` and `--neo-track-*` are consumed by the CSS but never set. Historical sources: (1) **`f48eb23`…`dbfa5b5` (2026-08-07 to 08-12, Dekan Brown)**: pointer and scroll parallax over separate painted layers (`sky-citadel.png`, `raidguild-panorama.png`, `hero-foreground.png`, all still in `public/images/neo/`), replaced by the video backdrop in `1557d1b` (2026-09-09). (2) **`4ffb591` (2026-08-19) to `5d8a82d^`**: the "curtain": `.heroExploring` set `--neo-curtain-open` (152 px, or `clamp(160px, 13vw, 250px)` from 1000 px) so the two foreground halves parted when hovering the title or the hero waypoints ("HOVER TO LOOK BEYOND"), removed in `5d8a82d` (2026-09-25, "Prepare venture beyond redesign for review") with the waypoints. Both can be recovered from history with their assets, but neither is in the approved baseline, and each brings UI that was removed (waypoints, hover prompt) or replaces the approved video backdrop. |

### Frame 122 refinements (2026-10-28, `~/Desktop/Frame 122.png`, a 1600 px layout at 2.4×)

| Area | Change |
|---|---|
| Hero curtain | Owner chose the August 19 – September 25 curtain (`4ffb591`, removed in `5d8a82d`). Historical behaviour (from `5d8a82d^:src/components/HomeExperience.{tsx,module.css}`): `.heroExploring` set `--neo-curtain-open` (152 px; `clamp(160px, 13vw, 250px)` from 1000 px), opening in 0.8 s and closing in 1.4 s on `cubic-bezier(.16,.76,.18,1)`, triggered by hovering or focusing the title or the waypoints, released 2.2 s after the pointer left. Restored on /clients only (`Hero curtain`): same distances, easing, timing and 2.2 s release; triggers are the title hover (fine pointer) and keyboard focus in the hero copy, plus scroll (opens progressively over the first 45% of the hero height), answering "make this layer react on parallax". Adaptations: no waypoints or "Hover to look beyond"; the copy no longer shifts (`--neo-track-title-x` not restored); touch screens, which had no foreground transform at all, get the curtain only, at `min(64px, 16vw)` on phones. Video, headline, CTAs and navigation unchanged; at rest every transform is as before. Reduced motion: nothing moves. Why it had looked static: the touch rule removed the transforms, the scroll offsets are clamped to hero height minus viewport (about 1 px since the hero became viewport-height), and nothing set the curtain variables after 5d8a82d. |
| Previous Works spacing | Frame 122 marks the space between the ticker and the heading. Section top `clamp(80px, 7vw, 104px)` (was 48 px; the section rhythm), heading to showcase `clamp(44px, 4vw, 64px)` (was 36). Mobile 72 px and 36 px (were 56 and 28). |
| Builder results | `builderGrid.ts` + `TeamWall` (`masonry`, /clients): 1–8 results render as an editorial grid that fills the wall's area: 12 × 3 on containers ≥ 720 px (container query), two columns below. Templates per count: 1 one feature card; 2 two feature cards; 3–4 asymmetric (a tall card, a wide card, compact cards); 5–8 denser mixes. Shapes set the composition (feature: large avatar beside; tall: avatar above; wide/compact: avatar beside). Names size to the card width and their own length (container units, minimum 14 px), roles wrap; nothing is clipped. Each builder appears once; links, filters, keyboard focus kept. 9+ results keep the moving wall; a wall that fits without moving now fills the width (Coordination at 1440). Real data has no 1- or 2-result category, so those layouts are covered by unit tests only. /community and / unchanged. |
| Begin a transmission | Two exclusive states (`surface="cyan"`): A shows the label, title, description, signal clue and "Start a Guild inquiry"; B hides all of it and shows the form in the same module (same width, position and background; height follows the form). The summary click sets state directly, so both never show in the same frame. Close ("Close the inquiry ↑", existing copy) and Back on step 1 return to A; Previous on later steps goes back a step; values are kept (the form stays mounted). Focus moves into the form on open (also from "Build with us") and back to the button on close. The 0.32 s fade is off with reduced motion. The form coordinates row is not shown in this module. |
| Form hierarchy | Close bar on top; heading 26–34 px (was about 58) over its supporting line in body type, then a divider; compact outlined stepper with a coral progress bar (site colours, was the shadcn card with the moloch bar); current step filled dark green; step title 22 px (was about 38); labels 15 px semibold; fields filled cream with a border and rounded corners (were underlines); Back/Previous outlined on the left, Next on the right. `ui/wizard.tsx` gains an optional `onExit` (Back on step 1) and `aria-current="step"`; `HireUs` passes `onExit` through. No fields, validation or submission changed. |

### Frame 123 refinements (2026-10-28, `~/Desktop/Frame 123.png`, a 1600 px layout at 1.8×)

| Area | Change |
|---|---|
| Builder heading | Was 64 px weight 400 on both lines, second line in Grinder Retalic. Now the showcase heading scale: lead 34 px weight 900, letter-spacing .01em, line-height 1.05; coral line 52 px Grinder italic 400. Mobile: lead 20 px, coral line `clamp(30px, 10.2vw, 48px)` (40 px at 393; "Of builders." is a letter longer than "Our clients"). Wording and colours unchanged. /clients only (`audience.module.css`). |
| Builder wall speed | Full moving wall 18 → 36 px/s on /clients (`TeamWall speed`, `BuilderNetwork` `WALL_SPEED_CLIENTS`); /community and / stay at 18. Measured 36.0 px/s at 1440 and 393, at most 1 px per frame, seamless across the loop seam. Adaptive grids (1–8 results) do not move. Reduced motion: still. |
| Form proportions | State B module 985 → about 700 px tall at 1440 (introduction state about 575). Module padding `clamp(20px, 2.6vw, 40px)` top; close bar 18 px below; wizard gap 14 px; buttons 44 px. |
| Form typography | Heading "Tell us about your project" 34 → 24 px on one line (Frame 123: "make it smaller"); the October 23 line "Three steps: introduce yourself, … before sending." removed (Frame 123: "remove this"); stepper title 13 px mono caps over a 13 px step name, 4 px coral bar; step pills 13 px; step title 18 px (was 22); labels 14 px semibold. |
| Stepper and pills | On the brand's lightest neutral `--scroll-100` (#F9F7E7) for Frame 123's "use white" (there is no pure white token); no borders; the current pill dark green with cream text. |
| Fields | Line-based: no fill, no side borders, a 1.5 px dark-green underline (55%), 44 px minimum height, textarea 84 px. Focus: coral underline, thickened. Invalid: `--moloch-600` underline; error text unchanged (moloch-600, 5.6:1). No field, validation or submission change. |

Frame 123 notes not covered by the brief, **not implemented** (open questions 17–18): "REMOVE THIS" on the
People section's "Explore all members ↗" link, and "MAKE GUTTER" beside the bottom-right of the
builder wall. No handwritten note asks for a faster wall; the speed change follows the brief.

### Full-bleed wall and showcase rotation (2026-10-28, after Frame 123)

| Area | Change |
|---|---|
| Builder wall | While it moves, the /clients wall runs edge to edge (`TeamWall bleed`, `data-bleed`): `margin-inline: calc(50% - 50vw)`, `width: 100vw`, the edge fade mask removed; the section's `overflow: hidden` clips it, so the page never scrolls sideways. The gaps between cards are unchanged (18 px desktop, 12 px mobile): "make gutter" read as the spacing between cards, per the owner. Heading, description, filters and count stay on the content grid. Whether the wall moves is judged against the section's full width, so it cannot flip between widths. Static lists (adaptive grids; Coordination at desktop widths, where it fits without moving) keep the content width. 36 px/s, seamless loop, dragging, filters and accessibility unchanged. /community unchanged (mask kept, no bleed). |
| Showcase rotation | `PreviousWorks rotate` (/clients): next project every 3 s, looping through all nine; the outgoing screenshot fades out over the incoming one (0.45 s) and the name and description fade in (0.35 s); the selected logo follows in every marquee. Manual selection (logos, previous/next, arrow keys) restarts the 3 s interval. Pauses while the mouse is over the showcase, while keyboard focus (`:focus-visible`) is inside it, while it is less than 35% on screen and while the tab is hidden; never runs with reduced motion (manual selection then switches without fades). Rotation changes are not announced (`aria-live="off"`); manual ones are (`polite`). The logo marquees keep their own movement and manual scrolling. Descriptions, links and assets unchanged. |

### /community: Join the DAO iteration (2026-10-28)

- The copy was already in the working tree when this session started it: `src/lib/narrative/community.ts`
  was edited at 21:45 outside this session (no other agent session was active on this worktree).
  Kept verbatim, as owner-supplied:
  - main CTA "Join our community" (hero, navigation and creed), destination unchanged
    (`https://portal.raidguild.org/join`);
  - Guild section: title "About / Moloch"; body (Moloch as coordination failure); disclosure
    "RaidGuild's Hats Tree" (roles, Hats Protocol, budgets and authority); "Stewardship" with
    "Stewards"; the requirement line "Explore the roles, responsibilities and paths that help the
    Guild coordinate."; CTAs "Explore the Hats Tree" (DAO Roles handbook page) and "Find your path
    into the Guild" (`membership/join-the-guild`); link "Hats Protocol ↗" (GitHub repository).
  - The long texts stay review-flagged claims (notes ask to confirm the lore, Hats assignments and
    steward roles); production renders them, as for other claims.
- This session added: the "DAO Roles ↗" link (wording flag) beside "Hats Protocol ↗", as the brief
  asks for links to both; the Guild mark instead of the Discord icon on "Find your path into the
  Guild" (a handbook link); a single Guild-kit entry now spans both columns
  (`.guildBenefits dl > div:only-child`, only /community has one entry); three narrative tests.
- Not changed: the separate Join section ("Join / the DAO", buttons "Join the DAO" and "Enter
  Discord"), /clients, assets, deploy configuration.
- Checks: `bun run test` 71/71, `bunx tsc --noEmit` passes, lint 0 errors (1 old warning),
  `bun run build` passes (run in an isolated copy so the dev server's `.next` is untouched).
  Production build: general 75/75 (includes /community hero and capabilities), rotation and bleed
  66/66 (includes /community), Frame 122/123 365/365, marquee 40/40; /community at 1440 and 393:
  no overflow, no console errors. Screenshots (local and the published review, before/after):
  `/private/tmp/claude-501/-Users-louchi-Projects-raidguild-integration/afb6ffad-2e28-42d6-b989-2be86bcb321f/scratchpad/join/`.

### Verification of the full-bleed wall and rotation (2026-10-28)

- `bun run test` 68/68. `tsc --noEmit` passes. Lint: 0 errors, the same 1 old warning.
- `SHOW_REVIEW_FLAGS=false bun run build` passes (isolated copy, no `.env*`), served on 3018 and
  stopped afterwards.
- Browser suites on the production build: rotation and bleed suite 66/66 (also on the dev
  server); Frame 122/123 suite 365/365; October 28 suite 96/96; general 75/75; marquee 40/40. The
  October 28 and general suites read the showcase screenshot as `#featured-work img`, which now
  also matches the hidden outgoing image during a crossfade; both now read the visible one.
- The rotation suite covers, at 1440 and 393 px: DAOhaus first; changes every 3 s in order
  (measured 2.85–3.4 s); a full loop of nine back to DAOhaus; crossfade and copy fade; the
  selected logo in sync; no announcements during rotation, announcements on manual choice; the
  logo marquee still moving; manual selection restarting the interval (no change within 2.4 s,
  a change by 3.5 s); hover pause and resume; keyboard focus pause, keyboard Next, resume on
  blur; no rotation offscreen; reduced motion still, with manual selection and no fades; no
  overflow or errors. The wall checks, at 1600, 1440, 393 and 375 px: edge to edge, no mask,
  cards crossing the viewport edge, gaps 18/12 px, heading and filters on the content grid, no
  page scroll, 36 px/s, dragging (desktop), filtered grids at the content width; /community
  unchanged.
- Screenshots: `/private/tmp/claude-501/-Users-louchi-Projects-raidguild-integration/afb6ffad-2e28-42d6-b989-2be86bcb321f/scratchpad/rot/final/`.
- Not verified: Safari, Firefox, physical devices, screen readers; with classic (non-overlay)
  scrollbars, `100vw` includes the scrollbar, so about half its width is clipped off each side.

### Verification of the Frame 123 refinements (2026-10-28)

- `bun run test` 68/68. `tsc --noEmit` passes. Lint: 0 errors, the same 1 old warning.
- `SHOW_REVIEW_FLAGS=false bun run build` passes (isolated copy, no `.env*`), served on 3018
  and stopped afterwards.
- Browser suites on the production build: Frame 122/123 suite 365/365 (also on the dev server;
  new: builder heading equal to the showcase heading, wall 31–41 px/s, a seamless wrap across the
  loop seam, the "Three steps" line gone, compact module height, line-based fields with coral
  focus and moloch error underlines, the stepper and pills on scroll-100, steps 1 → 2 → 3 with
  Complete offered but not pressed, Previous keeping values), October 28 suite 96/96, general
  75/75, marquee 40/40. Wall speed probe: /clients 36.0 px/s, /community 18.0 px/s.
- Screenshots (1440 and 393 px, 2× pixels):
  `/private/tmp/claude-501/-Users-louchi-Projects-raidguild-integration/afb6ffad-2e28-42d6-b989-2be86bcb321f/scratchpad/f123/final/`.
- Not verified: form submission (no backend), Safari, Firefox, physical devices, screen readers.

### Verification of the Frame 122 refinements (2026-10-28)

- `bun run test` 68/68 (new: every adaptive template covers its grid exactly once for 1–8
  results, wide and narrow; the agreed compositions; categories map to grid or wall).
  `tsc --noEmit` passes. Lint: 0 errors, the same 1 old warning.
- `SHOW_REVIEW_FLAGS=false bun run build` passes (isolated copy, no `.env*`), served on 3018
  and stopped afterwards.
- Browser suites on the production build: Frame 122 suite 315/315 (also on the dev server),
  October 28 suite 96/96 (two checks updated for the grid and the Close control), general 75/75,
  marquee 40/40. The earlier interaction suite (`p0.mjs`) is superseded by the Frame 122 suite,
  which carries its checks forward. The Frame 122 suite covers, at 1440, 1024, 393 and 375 px
  (reduced motion at 1440 and 393): curtain closed at rest, opening on title hover, holding then
  closing, opening on scroll (≤ 64 px on phones) and closing on return, nothing moving with
  reduced motion, video and headline kept, no waypoint prompt; showcase spacing; every filter
  (unique, count matches, grid filling the area with mixed proportions, legible, unclipped,
  links; wall without duplicates; a fitting wall full width); keyboard focus on cards; inquiry
  state A/B exclusive in every animation frame (mouse and keyboard), same module, focus moves,
  Close, Back, Previous, values kept, hierarchy sizes and contrast, Back left / Next right,
  "Build with us" opening state B; no overflow or console errors; /community and / unchanged.
- Screenshots (1440 and 393 px):
  `/private/tmp/claude-501/-Users-louchi-Projects-raidguild-integration/afb6ffad-2e28-42d6-b989-2be86bcb321f/scratchpad/f122/final/`.
- Not verified: form submission (no backend secrets; not attempted), Safari, Firefox, physical
  devices (the touch curtain was tested with emulated touch), screen readers.

### Verification of the interaction fixes (2026-10-28)

- `bun run test` 66/66 (new: masonry rows hold each filtered builder exactly once for every
  category; filter counts 30/5/4/3/6/12; nav CTA "Build with us" to `project-inquiry`).
  `tsc --noEmit` passes. Lint: 0 errors, the same 1 old warning.
- `SHOW_REVIEW_FLAGS=false bun run build` passes (isolated copy, no `.env*`), served on port
  3018 and stopped afterwards.
- Browser suites, production build: interaction regression suite 190/190 (also on the dev
  server); October 28 suite 96/96; general 75/75; marquee 40/40. The interaction suite covers,
  at 1440 and 393 px with and without reduced motion:
  - every filter: unique builders matching the count, nobody on screen twice, one copy in the
    accessibility tree, the loop copy never focusable, no loop copy for short lists or with
    reduced motion, the full wall still looping, profile links kept;
  - one inquiry module and one form; collapsed and expanded states; the form inside the
    light-blue module, no dark section, the module growing; reveal animation off with reduced
    motion; focus on the disclosure; validation message readable (≥ 4.5:1); Next to step 2
    (67%), Previous back with values kept; closing returns to the initial panel; reopening
    keeps values;
  - navigation "Build with us" (desktop and mobile menu), its destination, opening the
    embedded inquiry with focus; the other "Tell us what you're building" uses unchanged;
  - hero (unchanged, October 23 behaviour): layers respond to scroll and pointer, still with
    reduced motion; no overflow, no console errors;
  - /community (no masonry, unique results) and the / member wall.
- Before/after screenshots:
  `/private/tmp/claude-501/-Users-louchi-Projects-raidguild-integration/afb6ffad-2e28-42d6-b989-2be86bcb321f/scratchpad/oct28/before-p0/`
  and `.../oct28/after-p0/` (the "before" nav capture already shows the new label; the deployed
  review shows the old one).
- Not verified: form submission (the review has no backend secrets; not attempted), Safari,
  Firefox, physical devices, screen readers.

### Verification of the October 28 feedback (2026-10-28)

- `bun run test` 64/64. `tsc --noEmit` passes. `bun run lint`: 0 errors, the same 1 old warning.
- `SHOW_REVIEW_FLAGS=false bun run build` passes, built in an isolated copy of the working tree
  (scratchpad `build-oct28`, no `.env*`) so the running dev server was not disturbed, and served
  on port 3018 for the browser suites (stopped afterwards).
- Browser suites (Playwright, system Chrome), production build and dev server both:
  - general 75/75 (two Daedalus checks updated for the new copy and link);
  - marquee interaction 40/40;
  - new October 28 suite 96/96 at 1600, 1440, 393 and 375 px: no review flags, panel or
    dotted boxes; all nine descriptions and no title lines; Daedalus link and assets; people
    heading, intro, five cards, two columns on mobile, no sideways scroll; masonry three equal
    rows, varied card lengths, no truncation, wall moving, filters working; inquiry light blue
    with dark text, enlarged illustration, form opens; creed coral, mobile ≥ 600 px; no
    overflow, console errors or failed requests; dark theme inquiry unchanged; /community
    without masonry.
- Visual comparison with Frame 120 / Frame 121 at their own scale (1600 and 393 px), annotations
  excluded: people heading, wall, inquiry panel and creed follow the references. Screenshots:
  `/private/tmp/claude-501/-Users-louchi-Projects-raidguild-integration/afb6ffad-2e28-42d6-b989-2be86bcb321f/scratchpad/oct28/final/`.
  Differences that remain: the inquiry panel is about 600 × 640 px at 1600 (reference about
  634 × 619); the desktop illustration's visible artwork is about 505 px tall (reference about
  575). Not compared against the October 23 baseline (superseded for these sections by the
  owner's references). Not verified: Safari, Firefox, physical devices, screen readers.

## Released: Hire the DAO iteration (`da9165b`)

| Area | State |
|---|---|
| `/clients` hero | "Hard problems, / working products" (`oct27-design` source). Both lines are in the headline colour; the second line is larger. Supporting copy and CTAs are unchanged. |
| Guild ticker (`/`, `/clients`, `/community`) | SENIOR DEVS, SCOPED RAIDS, BUILT BY OWNERS replace MANY EDGES, ONCHAIN SYSTEMS, OPEN EXPERIMENTS (`GuildTicker.tsx`) |
| Client showcase | "What we've built for our clients": nine projects from `src/lib/data/caseStudies.ts`. Desktop has one looping marquee plus previous/next controls; mobile has two opposite marquees sharing one selection. |
| Marquee interaction | `primitives/LogoMarquee.tsx` drives one position from a frame loop. It writes the native scroll offset (whole px) plus a transform (the sub-pixel rest), at 64 px/s, over four copies of the logos that wrap by one set.<br>• Never pauses on hover.<br>• Trackpad, horizontal wheel, touch swipe and mouse drag scroll it; the automatic movement hands over and eases back in 0.9 s after the user stops.<br>• No wheel handler, so vertical wheel input and swipes scroll the page.<br>• A drag does not select; a click or tap does.<br>• Keyboard focus holds the strip still.<br>• Reduced motion turns automatic movement off but keeps scrolling and selection.<br>• It stops offscreen. |
| Case-study copy | DAOhaus, BrightID and Hypercerts keep their archive summaries (claims, as before). Livepeer and Pocket Network use Tae's text. Daedalus (`ddls.co`), Gitcoin, Problem and YieldNest show their name, screenshot and site link only. Ultimate Dominion and Gnosis are removed. |
| `/clients` Services | `sections/Services.tsx`: "What are you trying to ship?", the accordion with the foundry portrait (desktop) or horizontal cut (mobile), and "Discuss your project" on mobile. The second intro sentence is the owner-approved correction: "Owners, not vendors: we turn shared experience into focused offerings with end dates of their own." `/community` keeps `Capabilities.tsx` unchanged. |
| Scale corrections (approved) | Desktop: hero 58/73 px, "OUR CLIENTS" 52 px, project name 49 px, project title 33 px, logo buttons 190×73. Mobile: hero `min(34px, 8.4vw)`/`min(52px, 13.2vw)`, "OUR CLIENTS" 11.3vw, "TRYING TO SHIP?" 8.8vw, project name 44 px, logo buttons 210×81. Measured within about 1% of the design at 1600 px; on mobile, capped where the design text is wider than the screen. |
| Typography | Unchanged. The refined Grinder WOFF2 files stay. |

### Verification of the published review (2026-10-28, production URL)

- Version identity on `/clients`: release-only content is present ("Hard problems,", "What
  we've built for", the approved Services sentence, the new asset paths). Superseded content
  is absent ("Turn complex technology", Ultimate Dominion, the original design sentence,
  MANY EDGES).
- `/`, `/clients` and `/community` return HTTP 200 at 1440 and 375 px with no console errors.
- All 19 new assets return 200; `clients.pdf` returns 404 (not published). All nine external
  project links respond 200.
- No review notes, statuses or flags in the production HTML, and none in the static chunks
  (checked on the local build of the same archive).
- General suite 75/75 and marquee interaction suite 40/40 pass against the production URL.

### Verification before release (2026-10-28, local production build)

- **Technical:**
  - `bun run test` 64/64.
  - `tsc --noEmit` passes.
  - `bun run lint`: 0 errors, 1 warning that predates this work (unused `ThemeAnchor`, `HeaderJoin.tsx`).
  - `bun run build` passes.
- **Marquee interaction (Playwright, 1440×900 and 393×852): 40/40 checks pass.** They cover:
  - automatic movement, in opposite directions on mobile;
  - no pause on hover;
  - horizontal wheel scrolls the strip, not the page;
  - no drift while the user scrolls, then movement resumes;
  - vertical wheel over the strip scrolls the page;
  - mouse drag scrolls and does not select;
  - clicking a moving logo selects it, and the outline shows in all four copies;
  - touch: horizontal swipe scrolls each mobile marquee, vertical swipe scrolls the page,
    a tap selects from either marquee, and the selection is shared;
  - keyboard focus is visible, holds the strip and stays in view; arrow keys work;
  - seamless wrap: at most 1.1 px per frame, including across a wrap, for automatic
    movement in both directions and for manual scrolling past a set boundary both ways;
  - reduced motion: no movement, but scrolling and selection work.
- **General (Playwright, 1440×900 and 375×812): 75/75 checks pass.** They cover:
  - headline, ticker on all three routes, and the showcase heading;
  - marquee count, loop width, and selection from every marquee;
  - previous/next, arrow keys, keyboard focus stopping motion, and nine reachable logos;
  - project copy, screenshots and new-tab links;
  - accordion, mobile-only CTA and per-width illustration;
  - reduced motion;
  - no overflow, broken images or failed requests; Grinder loaded;
  - no review flags or notes in production;
  - `/community` hero and capabilities unchanged.
- **Review build** (`SHOW_REVIEW_FLAGS=true`): flags render, including the Services sentence.
  Dark theme has no overflow at either width.
- **Not verified:**
  - Physical devices: real trackpad momentum, iOS and Android touch flings (including a fling
    that crosses a wrap, where Safari may stop momentum), and Magic Mouse gestures. Touch was
    tested with Chrome's synthesized gestures; trackpad with synthetic wheel events.
  - Safari and Firefox.
  - Screen readers.
  - Widths other than 375, 393, 1440 and 1600.

### Remaining visual differences (left unchanged by decision, 2026-10-28)

Final screenshots, including captures at the designs' own scale (`truescale-*.png`), are in
the session scratchpad
(`/private/tmp/claude-501/-Users-louchi-Projects-raidguild-integration/afb6ffad-2e28-42d6-b989-2be86bcb321f/scratchpad/final/`).

1. **Type and logo scale:** corrected; see the table above. At 1440 px the project title
   ("Automated protocol maintenance", 33 px) wraps onto two lines because the copy column is
   narrower than at 1600 px. Mobile body copy still reads smaller than the full-canvas mobile
   design.
2. **Hero spacing.** The design keeps the dek and CTAs where they sat under the old
   four-line headline, about 100 px lower than in the build.
3. **Hero height** follows the viewport (`min(860px, 100svh)`, minimum 680 px), as before.
4. **Hero CTA at 375 px** wraps onto two lines, the same as the live release. At 393 px, the
   design's width, it fits on one line.
5. **Snapshot frame.** The design shows DAOhaus inside a blue frame; snapshots render as
   supplied, with rounded corners.
6. **Services label** stays at the 19 px minimum for pink text (`--type-accent-label`).
7. **Services intro** is about 8% narrower (544 vs about 592 px), and the desktop foundry
   illustration is about 10% smaller.

## Working tree

- HEAD: the iteration 04 commit (parent `6ecb1c7`, iteration 03; then `a8ff16c`, iteration 02; then
  `2bf270d`), pushed to `fork/feat/venture-beyond-integration`. `a8ff16c`
  It contains the documentation reconciliation, iteration 01, the Community follow-up, iteration 02, the
  owner's artwork in `public/images/venture/` (12 PNGs, approved for commit on 2026-10-29) and the deletion
  of `public/images/queen-raida/queen-raida-v2.png` (the owner removed it; nothing references it).
- **Owner's changes, preserved and still uncommitted:**
  - `package.json`: the `packageManager: yarn@1.22.22` line.
  - 21 manually deleted legacy images in `public/images/`: `cohort-*` (8), `expect-image-*` (4),
    `hire-image-*` (4) and `home-*` (5). Still in the repository and in the deployed archive;
    only unused components reference them.
- **Never commit these local files:** `public/images/casestudies/clients.pdf`; `.DS_Store` files.
- Do not run `bun run build` in this worktree while `bun run dev` is running; build in a copy
  (the dev server and the build share `.next`).

## Next actions

1. **Owner review** of iteration 04 at http://localhost:3017 (no Git preview exists for the fork). Any
   deploy needs explicit approval (AGENTS.md).
2. Answer the open questions below, especially those about `/community` (21–24) and the
   copy confirmations (1, 2, 19).
3. Decide on a documentation commit for this reconciliation, and on `release/review-2bf270d`
   (and `release/review-da9165b`) tags.
4. Physical-device checks: trackpad momentum, iOS and Android, Safari and Firefox, a screen reader.
5. Optional: rerun the Frame 122/123 suite on production for 1024, 393 and 375 px.

## Open questions

1. **Case-study titles.** The archive titles ("Automated protocol maintenance", "Social identity
   systems", "Tools for public goods funding") were removed with their summaries, so all nine
   projects read name → Tae's description. Restore them, or supply new titles?
2. **People intro** "These are some of the builders shipping the work. The full network is
   deeper." is transcribed from Frame 120/121. Confirm the wording (flagged as wording).
3. **Grinder licence.**
   - The supplied `Grinder-121888642.zip` holds the original 306-glyph cuts, the same files
     as the unused `Grinder-*.woff2`. An earlier copy carried an "iFonts — Demo for Personal
     Use" note.
   - The served refined cuts rest on the user's rights confirmation in `HANDOFF.md`. Retain
     the purchase record.
4. **`package.json` `packageManager: yarn`** conflicts with bun. Who added it, and should it stay?
5. **`docs/venture-integration.md`** still states Afacad Flux "instead of the missing Grinder
   cuts" in its first entry. The October 28 entry records the refined Grinder cuts. Should the
   first entry be marked superseded?
6. **`HANDOFF.md` blockers** (low-resolution videos, an unconfirmed `next build`) predate later
   work and have not been rechecked.
7. **`raidguild.estudioblanco.org`:** when and how should it be redirected to
   `raidguild-venture-beyond-review`?
8. **Release tags:** should `da9165b` and `2bf270d` get `release/review-*` tags, like the earlier
   review releases?
9. **Problem** is displayed as "Problem"; Tae's copy says "Problem Media". Rename the project?
10. **/community** shares the builder wall, people section and creed. Apply the masonry wall,
    coral "build." and taller mobile creed there too?
11. **Daedalus on /community** (`lib/data/venture.ts` partners) still links to `https://ddls.co/`
    with its own description; left unchanged.
12. **Review flags locally** now need `SHOW_REVIEW_FLAGS=true bun run dev --port 3017`. Keep
    this default?
13. **Hero curtain** (resolved 2026-10-28: the owner chose the August 19 curtain; restored on
    /clients). Open: is the full historical distance (about 187 px at 1440) right, should
    scroll open it too (the adaptation for "react on parallax"), and should /community and /
    get it?
14. **Inquiry form on the light-blue surface**: two colours were chosen for contrast on cyan:
    `--moloch-600` for field errors and the existing `#c92662` for the step headings. Confirm.
15. **Showcase spacing:** the brief said "between the heading and the showcase"; Frame 122's
    note sits between the ticker and the heading. Both gaps were increased; confirm the balance.
16. **Inquiry coordinates** ("Your project starts here · Contact · Project · Requirements") are
    no longer shown in the /clients module (they were inside the area Frame 122 marks to
    disappear). Keep them hidden?
17. **"Explore all members ↗"** (People behind the work, /clients): Frame 123 marks it "remove
    this"; the brief does not, and the previous round asked to keep the links. Remove it?
18. **"Make gutter"** (resolved 2026-10-28): the owner reads it as the spacing between cards; the
    wall now runs edge to edge and the card gaps are unchanged.
19. **Inquiry form copy** comes from the October 23 iteration (`40f3910`, via `9aa9bfc`), not
    Tae's brief or the narrative layer: "Tell us about your project", the step names, labels and
    placeholders. The "Three steps" line is removed per Frame 123; the rest is unchanged. The step
    name now appears three times (stepper, pill, step title). Approve the copy, or reduce the
    repetition?
20. **Showcase rotation interval**: 3 s, as asked, includes a 0.45 s crossfade; the longer
    descriptions (DAOhaus, BrightID) take longer than 3 s to read, so hover or focus pauses it.
    Keep 3 s?
21. **Join the DAO copy source**: this session could not see the owner's message with the approved
    Moloch copy; it kept the text already in `community.ts`. Confirm it is verbatim.
22. **Handbook domain**: "Explore the Hats Tree" and "DAO Roles ↗" point to
    `rg-handbook-nextra.vercel.app/dao-operations/dao-roles` (a Vercel domain); the official
    `handbook.raidguild.org/docs/dao-operations/dao-roles` also answers 200. "Explore the Hats Tree"
    goes to the DAO Roles page rather than a Hats tree view, and "Hats Protocol ↗" to the GitHub
    repository (hatsprotocol.xyz is the product site). Confirm the destinations.
23. **/community Join section** still reads "Join / the DAO" with "Join the DAO" and "Enter
    Discord". Align it with "Join our community"?
24. **Guild CTAs on desktop** now stack (the longer labels no longer fit side by side, as "Join the
    DAO" and "Enter Discord" did).
25. **Iteration 01 decisions:** (a) the dark filled-button pink is #CE1252, not canonical pink,
    so white labels pass 4.5:1; (b) /community keeps its coral hero line; (c) the October 23 Queen
    Raida carousel and the steward roster are no longer shown on /community; (d) "About RaidGuild"
    restores "Join the DAO" / "Enter Discord" and the four Guild-kit benefits verbatim, though the
    main CTA now reads "Join our community"; (e) Moloch uses Moloch red, not coral (coral fails
    body-text contrast); (f) the new labels "[ Queen Raida ]", "Featured roles", "Also in the tree",
    the snapshot caption and "DAO Roles ↗" are flagged as wording; (g) "Find your path into the
    Guild" wraps onto two lines in its pill at 393 px; (h) Projects and Experiments keeps its own
    heading scale. (Follow-up update: (b) superseded, the hero is now all white; (e) superseded, Moloch is
    coral with navy text; "Also in the tree" and "DAO Roles ↗" are no longer used.)
26. **Hats role descriptions:** no longer shown (the detail panel was removed in the follow-up).
    If they return: the handbook calls infrastructure "Infrastructure Maestro" and knowledge
    "Handbook Steward"; confirm the mapping first.
27. **Follow-up interpretations (2026-10-29):** (a) "Moloch Coral" read as the site's coral #EE3C78
    (it matches the Moloch artwork); no token of that name exists. (b) "Lilac/blue" text on coral is
    deep navy #12163B: navy and indigo fail contrast on coral. (c) The coral background on the builder
    network is a tilted band behind the masonry, not the whole section (so the heading and filters keep
    their contrast). (d) "The Participation Steward detail" read as the role detail panel below the
    tree (it showed whichever role was selected); the "Stewards." intro paragraph is kept. Confirm, or
    remove that paragraph too. (e) With no detail panel, the hat cards are no longer interactive.
28. **Join headline size on phones:** keeping "SERIOUS WEB3 BUILDERS" on one line makes it about
    23 px at 393 px (the Hire headline is 33 / 52 px and wraps "WORKING PRODUCTS" onto two lines below
    about 420 px). Accept the smaller headline, shorten the copy, or allow the wrap?
29. **Rights for the new artwork** in `public/images/venture/` were not stated; the earlier approval
    covered `queen-raida-v2.png`. Confirm public use. (The owner approved committing it on 2026-10-29.)
30. **Headline size on phones:** keeping each segment on one line makes the Join headline 16 / 20 px and
    the Hire headline 23.5 / 29.5 px at 393 px. Accept, shorten the copy, or allow a wrap on phones?
31. **"Explore the community →"** keeps the Portal join destination of the old primary CTA. Should it go
    elsewhere (for example the Portal home or an in-page section)?
32. **Builders:** short categories now use the masonry cards instead of the October 28 editorial grid;
    confirm that the grid can go for good.
33. **Guild kit on /clients:** the Guild module is not on /clients, so the expander exists only on
    /community. The H3, CTA, accordion, creed, builder and panel changes apply to both routes.
34. **Hero curtain on /community:** the owner's note was read as "Join should part its side panels like
    Hire" (light and dark already matched). Confirm, or describe the dark-theme motion meant.
35. **Hats selection** has no detail panel (removed in the follow-up); it only enlarges the card. Should a
    selected hat show anything else?
36. **Dark CTA labels:** resting filled buttons now use the ink label on canonical pink in dark too (white
    on canonical pink is 3.8:1); labels turn white on hover and press. Confirm this replaces the
    iteration 01 "white labels in dark" decision.
37. **Builder layouts:** short categories (≤ 8) never move; on phones they stack one card per line. The
    9+ tier still moves when wider than the screen (All builders everywhere, Coordination on phones).
44–46. **Builder module (October 30, later):** see the builder section (5–8 layout, phone wall face, grid
    height).
38–43. **Shared CTA system (October 30):** see "Remaining inconsistencies and open questions" in the October 30
    section (Moloch CTA variant, dark creed CTA, accordion and nav hovers, content cards, form button type).

## Iteration 04: Moloch title, builder layouts, CTA states (2026-10-29, committed with this note)

References: the owner's brief and the full-page captures of the iteration 03 preview
(`~/Downloads/screencapture-raidguild-venture-beyond-review-72zh7hv5h-vercel-app-*-2026-10-29-22_2*.png`,
unannotated). Decisions in `docs/venture-integration.md` (iteration 04 entry).

| Area | Change |
|---|---|
| About Moloch | Title "Together we slay" / "Moloch +" followed by the supplied `raidguild.png` (alt "RaidGuild"; its square is the coral #EE3C78, so only the swords show on the scene); 34 / 52 hierarchy kept. Body and CTA unchanged. |
| Explore | Description: "Games, tools, digital experiences, and field notes from Guild members. Explore what they made, how they approached it, and what they learned." (owner); filters, cards, interactions unchanged. |
| Typography | "The Guild runs on owners, / not employees." (/clients) keeps its display face (Grinder) via an override of the H3 Ubuntu rule; other supporting H3s and Hats labels stay Ubuntu. |
| Builders, both routes | One continuous full-width coral plane in every category, tilted 1°, its height following the courses (no empty container). Layout by result count (`data-tier`): 1–2 and 3–4 one course, 5–8 two courses (second staggered from 760 px), 9+ three courses (the moving wall when wider than the screen). Up to 8 results always sit still, wrap and centre inside the screen (phones stack them). Same cards, avatars, spacing, hover/focus. |
| /community order | About → Queen Raida → Moloch → Projects (Explore) → builders → Hats Tree → Join → Ideas → creed (Hats and Explore swapped). Dark: Join's scene is now navy so it differs from the deep-navy Hats Tree before it. |
| CTAs, both routes and themes | Filled buttons rest on the canonical pink #EE3C78 with the ink label (dark previously rested on #CE1252, the light hover colour); hover #CE1252 (light: cream label, dark: white label, cream ring); pressed #A80E44 (both). Outline, focus and disabled states verified. |

Incident during the session (fixed before commit): a CSS edit that replaced the builder-wall block also
deleted the blocks after it in `venture.module.css` (the H3 Ubuntu rule, the shared headline fit, the
Guild kit styles, the creed highlight). The suite caught it; they were restored from `6ecb1c7` and the full
diff against HEAD was reviewed.

### Verification of iteration 04 (2026-10-29)

- `bun run test` 80/80; `bunx tsc --noEmit --incremental false` passes; `bun run lint` 0 errors (the old
  `ThemeAnchor` warning).
- Isolated production build (`scratchpad/build-ds03`, no `.env*`) passes; 0 review ids; served on 3018, stopped.
- Browser suite `scratchpad/pw/ds05.mjs` (ds04 plus this pass): **1112/1112 on the dev server and on the
  production build.** Adds: section order with the swap; anchors #guild, #raida, #work, #team, #hats,
  #stewards, #join scroll to their sections (1440, 393); Moloch title text, logo loaded with alt, hierarchy;
  Explore description; "Guild runs on owners" in Grinder, other H3s Ubuntu; every builder category's tier,
  full-width plane hugging its content (within 40 px), up to 8 results still and inside the screen with one
  accessible copy; filled CTAs rest on canonical pink everywhere; filled rest/hover/pressed colours and
  label contrast, outline hover, keyboard focus ring and disabled state on both routes in both themes. The
  plane-height allowance was widened from 24 to 40 px after phones measured 2 px over (82 px of padding
  around the courses); no layout change.
- Screenshots (production build): `/private/tmp/claude-501/-Users-louchi-Projects-raidguild-integration/afb6ffad-2e28-42d6-b989-2be86bcb321f/scratchpad/ds05/final/`.
- Not verified: Safari, Firefox, physical devices, screen readers; parity with `40f3910`.

## Iteration 03: final visual refinement pass (2026-10-29, `6ecb1c7`, preview-deployed)

References: the owner's brief, the note "el parallax de la versión light no está desplazando los paneles
laterales; usar misma transición que dark", and `~/Desktop/Screenshot 2026-10-29 at 9.36.04 PM.png`
(Fullstack: the band as a plain container of stretched cards). The owner chose where the two unlisted
sections go (Projects after Builders; Ideas into Working Systems after Join). Decisions are in
`docs/venture-integration.md` (iteration 03 entry).

| Area | Change |
|---|---|
| Hero side panels | Measured: light and dark already behaved identically; the panels parted only on /clients (the curtain) and never on /community. Read as "Join should part its panels like Hire": /community now uses the same curtain (`Hero curtain still`), same distances and timing, both themes. Layer parallax stays off. |
| /community order | About RaidGuild → Queen Raida → About Moloch → Hats Tree → Builders → Projects & Experiments → Join → Ideas into Working Systems → creed. Dark neighbours stay distinct. |
| Hats Tree | Left: label, title, intro, and the stewards paragraph set apart (coral rule, "Stewards." in coral, 17 px). Right: the RaidGuild mark (88 px) with five curved SVG branches to the roles (no single trunk line). Cards read artwork, name, ID (Ubuntu). Cards are buttons again (`aria-pressed`): hover highlights; click, tap or keyboard focus selects (scale 1.1, 1.04 on phones), siblings dim to 62%; clicking again or Escape clears; reduced motion keeps the state without zoom. Phones: vertical tree with a rail and rounded stubs. |
| Headings | One two-level scale on both routes: 34 / 52 px desktop, 20 / ≤ 40 px phones (Projects, Services, Hats, Moloch, Queen Raida, builders); Guild 34 / 44 px (so "MEMBER-GOVERNED" holds one line when the kit opens); panel headings (Hire inquiry, Join) 30 / 46 px, second line on its own row. Every two-line heading's second line is ≥ 1.2× its first. |
| Builders | Short categories keep the wall's look: natural-width cards (never stretched), staggered brick rows, centred with auto margins (a wider list can't be cut off), on the same coral band tilted −1° with its rows and cards. |
| Creed | "build." on a coral highlight with deep navy type (#12163B), both themes. |
| Panels | The Hire panel is two stacked blocks; one coral stroke now wraps both (and the inquiry alone when the form is open). This fixes the iteration 02 stroke that framed only the introduction. Join unchanged (30 / 46 heading). |
| Themes | Light uses green, coral, cream and light blue only; no navy/night section surface in light (tested). |

Files: `src/app/(venture)/community/page.tsx`, `src/components/venture/sections/HatsTree.tsx`,
`src/components/venture/{hats,venture,services,feature,audience}.module.css`, `STATUS.md`,
`CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/venture-integration.md`.

### Verification of iteration 03 (2026-10-29)

- `bun run test` 79/79; `bunx tsc --noEmit --incremental false` passes; `bun run lint` 0 errors (the old
  `ThemeAnchor` warning).
- Isolated production build (`scratchpad/build-ds03`, no `.env*`) passes; 0 review ids; served on 3018, stopped.
- Browser suite `scratchpad/pw/ds04.mjs` (ds03 plus this pass): **882/882 on the production build and
  882/882 on the dev server.** Adds: section order with Moloch after Queen Raida; coral creed highlight;
  every two-line heading ≥ 1.2×; no navy surfaces in light; still builder lists unstretched and not cut
  off; Hats cards artwork → name → ID, five `aria-pressed` buttons, coral "Stewards", five branches meeting
  the parent and the cards; Hats hover highlight, click/tap select with zoom and dimmed siblings, no
  overflow, toggle off, keyboard focus selection with a ring, Tab moves it, Escape clears, reduced motion
  without zoom (1440 light, 1600 dark, 393 dark, 375 light); hero panels part on hover and scroll on both
  routes in both themes; Join heading 30 / 46. Suite bugs fixed while writing it (a stretch heuristic, the
  card text order) were in the tests, not the page.
- Screenshots (production build): `/private/tmp/claude-501/-Users-louchi-Projects-raidguild-integration/afb6ffad-2e28-42d6-b989-2be86bcb321f/scratchpad/ds04/final/` (`side-by-side-{light,dark}-{1440,393}.png`, full pages).
- Not verified: Safari, Firefox, physical devices, screen readers; parity with `40f3910`.

## Iteration 02: October 29 evening brief (2026-10-29, `a8ff16c`)

References: the owner's brief and the three Desktop captures of that evening
(`~/Desktop/Screenshot 2026-10-29 at 6.22.58 PM.png`, the Guild kit; `8.20.25 PM`, the builder band in the
Coordination filter; `8.38.17 PM`, the Join panel with review markers on its heading, body and actions).
Decisions are in `docs/venture-integration.md` (iteration 02 entry). Applied to both routes wherever the
module is shared.

| Area | Change |
|---|---|
| Hero, /community | Owner copy: eyebrow "[ THE GUILD ]", "Find your people." / "Build something together.", the new subtitle ("builder owned community" in bold), "Explore the community →" (Portal join, unchanged destination) and "See what we’re building ↓" (#work). |
| Hero, both routes | No parallax: `Hero still` turns off the pointer and scroll layer motion and the copy fade (the /clients curtain stays). One headline rule: the second line scales to its space (≤ 73 px), the first at 58:73, each on one line at every width; `--title-fit` holds each route's measured line width. Phones: Join 16 / 20 px, Hire 23.5 / 29.5 px at 393 px (Hire previously wrapped "WORKING PRODUCTS"). Eyebrow 17 px bold with a shadow. |
| H3 | Ubuntu on both routes, including h3 em, never Grinder or Retalic (`!important`, since module rules are more specific). Hat labels Ubuntu. "The Guild runs on owners" (/clients) is now Ubuntu. |
| Guild kit, /community | `GuildPrologue kitExpander`: a "Your Guild kit →" button (`aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`). Desktop: the kit panel slides in from the right in its own grid column and pushes the illustration and text left. Phones: it opens below the text. Closed it is hidden and `inert`; Escape (anywhere) or its close button closes it and returns focus to the toggle; no animation with reduced motion. Not shared with /clients (the module is /community only); "/" keeps the inline kit. |
| Queen Raida, Moloch | Desktop cut confirmed on desktop, mobile on phones, rectangle on tablets and squarer monitors. Artwork held to `min(58svh, 600px)` (phones 72svh), cropped from the bottom (`object-position: top`); copy 28–44 px below it. No parallax: the files are single flattened images. |
| Hats Tree | Desktop: title, both texts and the tree link on the left, a smaller tree on the right (96 px RaidGuild mark, five compact cards); one column below 961 px, a vertical tree on phones. The "Explore the roles…" line was removed; one link remains. |
| Builders, both routes | One card system for every category: the editorial grid for short lists (`builderGrid.ts`, Frame 122) is removed; all categories use the masonry cards (short lists one or two per row, still). Every category runs on the coral band, tilted −1° together with its rows and cards (no counter-rotation). |
| CTAs | Dark filled buttons: hover #E0185E and pressed #A80E44, distinct from the resting #CE1252 (hover previously equalled rest). Equivalent actions share icons: Portal actions → (hero, Guild "Join the DAO", Join, creed on /community), in-page ↓ (creed on /clients). Every visible link, button and disclosure is ≥ 44 px tall (brand, socials, handbook links, "See more", footnote links). |
| Expandable rows | Services accordion (both routes): titles 700 at full contrast; descriptions at 82% of the text colour (≥ 7:1). |
| Creed, both routes | "build." preselected: indigo #303675 highlight with cream type (9:1), no shadow. |
| Join, /community | Owner copy: "Your first step / into the Guild." (Grinder, regular weight, not italic), new subtitle, "Create your Portal profile →". The rounded coral-stroked panel now frames the /clients inquiry panel too. |
| Projects heading | "What happens when builders / follow their curiosity." (owner); nav label and anchor unchanged. |

### Verification of iteration 02 (2026-10-29)

- `bun run test` 79/79 (copy tests updated to the brief; builder-grid tests replaced by a masonry test).
  `bunx tsc --noEmit --incremental false` passes. `bun run lint`: 0 errors, the old `ThemeAnchor` warning.
- `SHOW_REVIEW_FLAGS=false bun run build` passes in an isolated copy (`scratchpad/build-ds03`, fresh
  `bun install --frozen-lockfile`, no `.env*`); 0 review ids in `/clients` and `/community`; served on 3018, stopped.
- Browser suite `scratchpad/pw/ds03.mjs`: **712/712 on the dev server and 712/712 on the production build.**
  Both routes at 1600, 1440, 393, 375 px, light and dark: hero copy and CTAs, one-line headlines inside the
  screen, no parallax on scroll or pointer, eyebrow weight, filled-button contrast, 44 px targets for every
  visible link/button/disclosure, all H3 in Ubuntu, accordion title/description contrast, creed highlight and
  CTA icon, every builder category (counts, uniqueness, one accessible copy, same masonry cards and heights,
  coral band at −1° with no counter-rotation, card contrast), no overflow, no broken images or failed
  requests, no console errors, audience switch (fixed, `aria-current`, 44 px, in view at the bottom), coral
  panel stroke on both routes; /community: section order, art cuts and heights, gap to copy, Moloch contrast,
  Projects heading, Hats composition, parent mark, order, Ubuntu labels, single link, scenes, connectors, Join
  copy and Grinder Regular, link contrast. Guild kit at 1600/1440/393/375: closed and inert, Enter opens it
  (desktop from the right with the image and text moving left; phones below the text, no overflow), Escape
  and the close button close it and return focus, reduced motion without animation. Art direction at
  1024×768, 1280×1024, 820×1180, 1920×1080, 1600×900, 700 px. Keyboard reach of the switch, CTA rest vs hover
  and focus rings, wall speed, reduced motion on both routes; /clients curtain, rotation and inquiry.
  While writing the suite, its own bugs (a CSS-module selector, a colour parser, rotated card heights,
  object-position format, a missing `.copy` class in `hats.module.css`) were fixed; one real defect found:
  Escape did not close the kit after a click on its text (fixed with a document listener).

  pages). The session scratchpad was wiped once during the day: the iteration 01 and follow-up screenshots
  and scripts listed in older sections below no longer exist.
- Not verified: Safari, Firefox, physical devices, screen readers; visual parity with `40f3910` (superseded
  modules); the attached captures were compared by eye only.

## Community visual refinement follow-up (2026-10-29; committed with iteration 02)

Two passes on the owner's brief of the evening of October 29. A first pass (another session, about
18:48) changed `HatsTree.tsx`, `hats.module.css` and `venture.module.css` and left 3 tests failing
(75/78) without a browser check. This session (second pass) completed it and corrected it; decisions
are in `docs/venture-integration.md` (follow-up entry), artwork in `docs/asset-provenance.md`.

**Owner's working-tree changes found at the start** (left untouched): `public/images/queen-raida/`
removed (tracked `queen-raida-v2.png` deleted, untracked vertical cut gone); new untracked artwork in
`public/images/venture/entities/{queen-raida,moloch}/` (desktop, rectangle, mobile) and
`public/images/venture/hats/` (five 600 × 600 hats plus `raidguild.png`), replacing the iteration 01
placeholders (which no longer exist). `.DS_Store` files are also in `public/images/venture/`.

| Area | Change |
|---|---|
| Hero (/community) | Both segments white and on one line at every width; the second line scales to its space (≤ 73 px), the first at 58:73. 393 px: 18.5 / 23.3 px (was 33 / 52 px with the line clipped). /clients unchanged. |
| Queen Raida, Moloch | Owner's cuts via `<picture>`: mobile ≤ 700 px, rectangle at ≤ 1199 px or aspect ≤ 3:2, desktop otherwise. Missing-file fallback removed. The dormant October 23 carousel's artwork reference points to `queen-rectangle.png` (the old file was deleted). |
| Builder wall | Masonry on a coral (#EE3C78) band tilted −1°, wall counter-rotated +1° (level cards); opaque cards (cream / navy); section keeps its surface; band clipped, no overflow. Replaces the first pass's whole-section Moloch red and net-zero ±0.6° tilt. |
| Join | 2 px coral stroke, 28 px radius (first pass). Membership-guide link dark green on the light panel (was cream on light blue). |
| Moloch | Coral background, deep navy #12163B text (4.6:1), navy pill CTA with a white label. |
| Hats Tree | `raidguild.png` parent node with connectors to the five roles; removed "Also in the tree", the role detail panel, the pill CTA and the DAO Roles / GitHub links; one link "Explore the Hats Tree ↗" to tree 1822; cards are a plain list (no buttons); "Stewards." intro paragraph restored (approved copy, removed by the first pass). Deep navy in dark (no green), dark green in light. |
| H3 | Ubuntu on /community (first pass applied it to both routes; now scoped). |
| Audience switch | Unchanged; verified fixed, `aria-current`, 44 px targets, keyboard focus ring. |

Files touched in this follow-up: `src/app/(venture)/community/page.tsx`,
`src/components/venture/sections/{HatsTree,ImmersiveFeature}.tsx`,
`src/components/venture/{hats,feature,venture}.module.css`, `src/lib/data/{hats,illustrations}.ts`,

### Verification (2026-10-29, this session)

- `bun run test`: 80/80 (artwork contract updated to the owner's files and sizes; Hats single link;
  new coral-scene contrast tests). `bunx tsc --noEmit --incremental false`: passes. `bun run lint`:
  0 errors, the old `ThemeAnchor` warning (`HeaderJoin.tsx:78`).
- `SHOW_REVIEW_FLAGS=false bun run build` passes in an isolated copy (`scratchpad/build-ds01`, no
  `.env*`); 0 review ids in the prerendered `/community`; served on 3018, then stopped.
- Browser suite `scratchpad/pw/ds02.mjs` (Playwright, system Chrome): production build 476/476. Dev
  server: first run 475/476, one real failure, a transient `net::ERR_CONNECTION_RESET` at
  `/community` 1600 light while full-page captures ran against 3018; rerun alone 476/476. A first-run
  test bug (/clients panel border read as style rather than width) was fixed in the suite, not the page.
  Covers /clients and /community at 1600, 1440, 393, 375 px in light and dark: Join headline one line
  per segment, white, inside the screen; /clients headline unchanged; filled-button contrast; builder
  filters and counts; coral band, tilt angles, level cards, card contrast; no overflow, broken images,
  failed requests or console errors; audience switch fixed, `aria-current`, ≥ 44 px, in view at the
  page bottom; section order; artwork cuts, full width, copy below, alt text; Moloch coral and navy
  text ≥ 4.5:1, CTA contrast; Hats parent mark, five roles in order, removed elements absent, exactly
  one link to tree 1822, intro and snapshot, scene colours, connectors meeting; all H3 Ubuntu; Join
  stroke, radius and link contrast; distinct dark scenes with no green. Also: rectangle cut at
  1024 × 768, 1280 × 1024, 820 × 1180 and 701 px, desktop cut at 1920 × 1080, mobile at 700 px; keyboard
  reach and focus rings on the switch and the Hats link (1440, 393); wall 36 px/s; reduced motion
  (still wall, band kept); /clients curtain, rotation and inquiry unchanged.
- Screenshots (production build): `/private/tmp/claude-501/-Users-louchi-Projects-raidguild-integration/afb6ffad-2e28-42d6-b989-2be86bcb321f/scratchpad/ds02/final/` (side by side `side-by-side-{light,dark}-{1440,393}.png`,
  full pages per route). Before-state captures of the first pass: `/private/tmp/claude-501/-Users-louchi-Projects-raidguild-integration/afb6ffad-2e28-42d6-b989-2be86bcb321f/scratchpad/ds02/before/`.
- Not verified: Safari, Firefox, physical devices, screen readers, 1600 px screenshots (suite only),
  visual parity with `40f3910` (these modules are new or superseded by later owner references).
