// The October 23 Hire composition (40f3910), reordered November 2: hero →
// services gallery (replaces the services accordion) → previous works →
// builders → people → buyer FAQ → inquiry (November 3: "Why RaidGuild"
// reasons follow the services gallery), with the October 27 hero and client
// showcase. Unconfirmed claims are flagged in review builds and
// preview; keep the route out of search until they are resolved.
// SEO copy (October 30, owner): the page title stands alone (no "| RaidGuild"
// template); Open Graph and Twitter carry the Hire title and the same
// description. A page's openGraph replaces the root's, so the site name, type
// and this route's URL are restated. Share image (October 30): a 1200 × 630
// WebP cut of the Queen Raida rectangle artwork (public/images/venture/og/,
// 150 KB; the 6 MB original is untouched).
