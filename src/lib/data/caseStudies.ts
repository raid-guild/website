// project has its custom logo button, a screenshot of its own website, and its
// official site. Descriptions of RaidGuild's work are not stored here; they
// live in the narrative layer with their review status (lib/narrative/clients.ts).
// Links follow clients.pdf, except Daedalus, which links to https://ddls.co
// (owner, October 28). The Daedalus button and screenshot were replaced by the
// owner on October 28.
